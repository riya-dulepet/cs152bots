Really bizarre sub. I some times peruse it because some of the more sane posts sometimes have helpful insights into the female experience. On one hand they fucking hate men. It is straight-up sexism that would not stand if the genders were reversed. On the other hand 99% of them seem to not get the irony that they consider themselves a catch, yet they mostly shitpost about getting as much dick in themselves as possible. On the front page right now there is a post ranting about how the OP is taking dick from "three different low value males" and how that empowers her while waiting for a "high value male". I'm no expert but the sort of guy that they consider the gold standard is either going to be married or smart enough not to pay attention to the kind of people who post on that sub. &#x200B; Like, the mental gymnastics in that sub would win gold at the olympics.
Gotta admit, this bitch is hot as fuck. Probably my top 5 hottest bitches. But she is a piece of shit human being
>Please keep in mind that just because YOU view someone as a normie or a becky or whatever does not mean that other people do or that the person you are referring to even thinks they are. THINKING you're ugly is vastly different from actually BEING ugly. It doesn't matter that they may perceive themselves as ugly, we do not share the same experiences and they have no right to infiltrate one of the few spaces genuinely ugly people have. Ugly women in real life have no voice. Normies are committed to ensuring that we don't have a voice online either by stealing spaces meant for us, then having the AUDACITY to expect us to have sympathy for them because :( they're insecure :(. They should not be here and it's not my responsibility to coddle normal or attractive people with low self-esteem.
the second point is the most blatant lie i've ever seen , we've barely gotten past february and i've already come across around 17 articles of women killing their husbands this year , i wasn't even searching for such articles...just why are feminists like this, they are willing to push a lie denying lots of victims help all in a bid to demonize men
Also looking at her Crocodile Tears, the ThOT got a real smooth Pussy Pass.
I'm so tired of beckies and stacies being allowed here. What's the point of them being in a space that has little correlation to them? Maybe it's just me but I actually get upset when I see a Stacy or Becky posting here lmao
Of course it's good wtf are you smoking But she must be low SMV if she's scarcity? I mean even some landwhales have orbiters and big egos Or maybe you're better than all her other options Either way all hoes are hypergamous so don't get too comfortable and stay on game always
Or the trend to like nerdy unpopular shy guys like wtf ugly men be wanting to date hot stacies while they look ugly af.
WTF??? What a disgusting bitch! How can we arrest her? She seriously needs to be arrested. What a piece of scum. Also, Issac Butterfield is pretty cool!
Lack of romance and intimacy is NOT my biggest issue with inceldomIt's **bullying**. It still occurs to me at the age of 21 in medical university. People in general associate bullying with middle school when kids undergo puberty, but it still continues for me... I *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. But bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. *Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly "eew", "hell no", "he is ugly".... For instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an "eew" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite. How am I supposed to be confident? How can I become a doctor when I cannot look in people's eyes from bullying? FML. I am clean. I shower twice a day. I shave and have a professional haircut. I use Chanel. I ride a scooter. I care for my skin. I am super kind and friendly. I am fit (BMI 20). I wear expensive clothes.
A week after this was originally reported various media have played it up again in ways that are promotional for her. She will actually make money out of it. She wouldn't be the first woman to act in perverted ways towards boys and subsequently profit. It's been quite lucrative for some.
Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*. Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general. Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex. If they did, society and culture would look completely different. Even in "modern" super liberal attitude countries you see it. Women just aren't into it. Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date. You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience. Women wouldn't whine about "cat calling". Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women. If women pursued sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on. And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life. So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't. Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts. Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors. Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero. if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that. Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them. Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do. Women don't give a shit about sex. Not really. they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that? Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole. Whereas women don't think a hard cock is a hard cock, which is why they have 500000 requirements to fuck, whereas a man just requires a woman to be willing and available.
My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a "shit test", the girl was straight up like "fuck off" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues. It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those "don't listen to what girls say, see what they do". This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially "get it". I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion. The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say "excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the "genuine" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like "this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?". Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the "lucky one who wants a compliment", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in "models" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach. TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.
Guy at my LTRs job is trying fuck herMy LTR of 18 months called me this morning saying she feels guilty. A guy she works with has been flirting with her. She said, she felt bad because she didnt completely negate his sexual behavior and briefly entertained the idea at the time. She has brought him up to me before and she considered him to be one of the few people at work that she could be friendly with, since the place is loaded with overweight, snarky Karens. I asked her if she did anything with him and she said no, which I do believe right now. Shes been working at this place for about 3 months and she told me about the guy from the beginning. I sensed it would come to this at some point. I laughed it off and told her oh that must be your work husband. She also told me hes kinda fat and that Im much better looking. If hes working as a nurse, I also know Im more financially stable than him. The guy does know about me and yet he continues to pursue my girl. This man has an LTR and a child which he lives with. He told her that his girlfriend would be cool with it if they had a thing on the side and that his gf is also bisexual. I dont know how she responded to him because I didnt take it too seriously when she brought it up. When she told me about it, I said I appreciate your honesty and Im not gonna hold it against you. Is this guy texting you? She said; no he doesnt have my number. Then I said, Ive seen the type of guys that hit on you and Im not worried about any of them lol. She laughed and got slightly offended. My LTR is definitely the type to crave male attention from what I can see and Im sure she was flattered by the fact that this guy pushed up on her. My question is, am I going to have to demote this girl to a plate eventually? Is this a major red flag? Whats the likelihood she ends up fucking this dude? Do I have to go down to her job and fight this dude? Ive been way too available to this woman for the past 4-5 months. Taking every phone call on her break and spending all my free time with her. Should I start ignoring her calls and distancing myself from her more? I just setup some dating apps and Im beginning to cultivate new leads on girls. Am I overreacting to this whole thing? What do you guys think I should do?

If I See ONE More Goddamn Becky or Stacylite Complaining on Here...The amount of Beckies/Stacylites I see on this sub [MAKES ME SICK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8UnlsUGsIU) I now feel obligated to look at someone's history before I upvote or reply because I refuse to acknowledge obnoxious attention-whoring normies. Every single time I click on one of their profiles I'm greeted with 700 selfies on various subs. Huh? If you seriously believed you were ugly you wouldn't post your pics all over Reddit. Like what in the goddamn fuck are all of you complaining about? I literally don't get it. Are you just mad that you're not a gigastacy with 100k+ ig followers? Feeling like you have the right to bitch about your normal ass life to a bunch of people who are actually struggling is just gross and condescending. Stop it. Now. These people need to get banned.
Because if she say boo the police will haul him away.
Not if you are a woman it seems. Sad.
The Crazy Bitch and Bad Boy combination never ends well.

Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls** Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace. **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.** Note I say they are hoping you find them. Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins. You have to do the work. I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women. So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working. What we do as men isnt easy. When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.) My primary slave girl is a doctor. When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision. If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu. If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.* And I do. **Gaming Submissive Girls** Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun. Try on some light teasing. **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.** Many a truth was first spoken in jest. You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express. Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved. If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.* Then STFU. If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men? Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?* If she says and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.* Then change the topic. You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy. Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work. I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with. I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny. It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc. you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.* *But Uncle Vasya! Isnt that SEXIST?!* Well, yes it is, but thats the point. Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc. so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!* or better yet, *"No guy has ever talked to me like this before!"* That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. **Chatting Her Up.** **Kino is Key.** Physicalize things early. Do not underestimate the power or touch. One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug. Sometimes I will do this with one arm. I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.* You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.* A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs. Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs. She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.* **Display dominance.** If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is. By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}. Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1 If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No. I am the man, and you are the girl. I will plan the date.*^2 Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!* Its a relief to them. There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want. I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww! That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags. They shame men for doing Masculine Things. Should those asshats be making up rules for you? Fuck^NO! You wanna know what that line results in most often? Pretty underwear. That I get to see. And remove. Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.* Fair point to her. It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole! How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!* Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you. As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.* The guys then reach out to me for advice *What should I say?!* the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure. Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do. Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation. **The Coup De Grace** If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her. If its public, I might whisper it in her ear: *I know your secret.* Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin. Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*. How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!* Give her a sly look and say, *You know, your secret.* She will continue to try to pry it out of you. Say, *You know. The one you have tried to hide all of your life.* Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.* {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.} I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew. Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3 Another typical reply, *I am a hunter. I know my prey.* That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss. Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements. Thats perfectly fine. Im not trying to force a bad fit. Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)** I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want. Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want. One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool. I don't try to "force" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl. The key to that is abundance. I am also not trying to project my own "Disney" fantasy onto a girl. I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into? I simply give them what they want. And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.* **Takeaways** -Submissive girls are fun. -Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours. Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive. -Not every girl is going to walk this path. Release those back into the wild. -With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).** -Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)** ^1 In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow. Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue. ^2 Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever). Dont over plan. ^3 Mild condescension is ok. Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about. Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid. Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.
Feminists are the cause of this discrimination in the first place.
Isn't this what they wanted ? To kill "traditional gender roles" or it doesn't work like that when they need to move their asses and do actual work ?
Me too Honestly Im tired of fatcels and girls that literally havent even tried to put effort into their appearance or be more outgoing either.

If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach. TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.
"Have something that appeals to women" I have seen women wear these kinds of shoes before and they have no problem with it. I hate it when bitches like this use their sex as an excuse just to argue, when reality what she actually means is: "Make a shoe that I will like because im selfish." And if these shoe companies dont make shoes you like, how about you just *Go find another company?*
Waste of money. Cars, like height, are a looks multiplier. If a girl is attracted to you, a cool car or good height might make her more attracted to you. A lot of guys delude themselves into thinking having a cool car or whatever will make them a hit with women. But even bluepilled "shower more" women aren't claiming you should carmaxx. Besides, Chad could drive a 1994 Grand Am, and Stacy will just think he's sensible.
Chads are top 20% of population.They are the highest tier of men.Meanwhile women have far more sex at only 13% sexlessness while guys are at 30%.Really makes you wonder huh
Had my first date in 3 months. Accidentally blew my load in a minute - Can this be salvaged?Well boys - Have I got a story for y'all. I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, or how to play this moving forward. Like many of you, I've been in quarantine for the past 2 months. Finally, in the last 2 weeks, I decided to say fuck it and download Tinder again. Before that, I was doing some solid self-introspection, reading, home workouts, learning to trade options, no drinking, no weed, lots of meditation. All was well. I was feeling great! During this time, I also stayed away from Porn and only jacked it once a week to no porn. Fast forward to yesterday and I had my first outside date with a bird in that span of time. Super fucking cute, short Asian girl with amazing tits. I took her to my usual spot, which is this outdoor walking street with cafes and whatnot. We grab some cold drinks and start working around the area. All was going phenomenal with exceptional banter, kino, easy-flowing conversation, etc. I said let's get outta here and we headed back to my place to 'watch a documentary' as that's what it said she liked to do in her profile. We hung out on the couch, more kino, kissing, slowing escalating, she's getting wet and ready to go. It's getting to the point where she has to go home, but I take is LMR and just keep escalating. Eventually, her dress on the floor and those gorgeous fucking tits are flopping around in my face. We're both naked and eventually, I caveman carry her to my bed. We're still working up to sex, which is fine, so I flip her around and we start 69'ing. Well here's where it all went to hell! After 2 months of quarantine, and not even having the chance to touch a bird, I fucking let myself accidentally get way over-excited, and as she's giving me the best head this side of 6 months - using her mouth in ways only god knows - before you know it I'm shooting a giant premature fucking load in her mouth. I lasted maybe a minute. Not my proudest minute at that. I had no problem when she was jacking me off vigorously, but as soon as she went down on me, while I'm eating her out, I fucking lost it. I haven't cum this fast in years. To make matters worse, she jumps up and runs to the bathroom to spit out my spunk, just leaving me sitting there on the bed. I mean, maybe she was surprised at my load, maybe I fucking hit the back of her throat. I don't fucking know. She comes back out of the bathroom, and I try to play it off as if I'm just gonna finish her. I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home - it's 11:30 pm and she has to wake up at 7 am. I say cool and here's where she proceeds to give me the ego dick punch of death. "Oh - you came so fast" in what can only be described as a disappointing tone. I wasn't quick enough on my feet to come up with a good line, but I also didn't fucking show emotion either. I just played it off to quarantine and not having any action in a while. Just like it was no big deal, and just hoping it was a shit-test. So many other things I could have said, trust me I know. But the damage was done and my ego lay in tiny fucking shards all over the floor. So boys - what do you think? Any chance of salvaging this. I feel like there's no fucking way I'm gonna contact her now. Gonna just have to wait for her. And if she does contact, I'll just never bring it up again like it never even happened. Again - every other part of the date was great. I actually enjoyed conversing with her. That is the first time in a while. Thing is, I've got 3 more dates lined up with 3 different birds this week alone, but I'll be dammed if my ego won't let me forget this performance. Of course, I want the revenge fuck now to show her what I can really do in bed. What do you think lads? **Edit #1**: She literally just reached out asking for some innocuous link to another documentary I had mentioned. If she really wanted to ghost, she wouldn't have contacted at all, I think. **Edit #2:** Lads, you're all legends! Cheers for the solid advice from all of you. I truly appreciate it. Some hard lessons to learn, but that's all part of the process. As a consensus: DGAF Attitude, Amused Mastery, Ego is the Enemy, Better Psychological Stimulation, and Eat that Pussy Better are the lessons learned. Just been a little outta practice. Quarantine does weird shit to the social skills. But it will all come back. On to the next one!
Legit I love the bitch he adds at the end it most likely frustrates her further which makes me happy prick gets what she fucking deserves
3One Approach Every Day Challenge - Day 33-----Day 3----- So today I was at a trampoline park with a friend. We ended up playing dodgeball against two very cute girls. After we played 2 rounds I approached one of them. Me: "Hey wait a second" Her: "Oh hey" Me: "Don't worry I don't want to sell you anything, I just think you are very cute. Do you maybe want to grab a coffee sometime?" Her: "Oh I'm sorry but I have a bf" Me: "Well maybe then a coffee as friends?" Hey: "sry I don't think this will be possible" So basically a flake again but I got her Instagram
Spez is a cuck, also if you n word bot him it says he used the hard R lol
My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends. Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man. Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early. Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..) Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!). We divorced 6 months later when she cheated. Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed. Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids. Married the first mom type I found. several kids and 15 years later, she gets the "unhappies".. Divorce cost over 500k. My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand. Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them. Lessons, for you younger brothers? Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real. (Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.) Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts. Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS. Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be " the victim".. The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone.. So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are.. Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER. In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them. Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back. And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks. Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you. Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's "different". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you. And, be of good cheer. They quarantine you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!
>I love beating women. I like to hear them scream while I leave them to die in my basement Wow OP, just wow.
Do you guys really call women sluts?
Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls** Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace. **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.** Note I say they are hoping you find them. Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins. You have to do the work. I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women. So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working. What we do as men isnt easy. When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.) My primary slave girl is a doctor. When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision. If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu. If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.* And I do. **Gaming Submissive Girls** Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun. Try on some light teasing. **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.** Many a truth was first spoken in jest. You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express. Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved. If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.* Then STFU. If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men? Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?* If she says and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.* Then change the topic. You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy. Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work. I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with. I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny. It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc. you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.* *But Uncle Vasya! Isnt that SEXIST?!* Well, yes it is, but thats the point. Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc. so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!* or better yet, *"No guy has ever talked to me like this before!"* That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. **Chatting Her Up.** **Kino is Key.** Physicalize things early. Do not underestimate the power or touch. One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug. Sometimes I will do this with one arm. I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.* You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.* A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs. Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs. She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.* **Display dominance.** If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is. By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}. Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1 If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No. I am the man, and you are the girl. I will plan the date.*^2 Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!* Its a relief to them. There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want. I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww! That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags. They shame men for doing Masculine Things. Should those asshats be making up rules for you? Fuck^NO! You wanna know what that line results in most often? Pretty underwear. That I get to see. And remove. Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.* Fair point to her. It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole! How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!* Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you. As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.* The guys then reach out to me for advice *What should I say?!* the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure. Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do. Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation. **The Coup De Grace** If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her. If its public, I might whisper it in her ear: *I know your secret.* Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin. Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*. How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!* Give her a sly look and say, *You know, your secret.* She will continue to try to pry it out of you. Say, *You know. The one you have tried to hide all of your life.* Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.* {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.} I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew. Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3 Another typical reply, *I am a hunter. I know my prey.* That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss. Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements. Thats perfectly fine. Im not trying to force a bad fit. Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)** I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want. Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want. One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool. I don't try to "force" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl. The key to that is abundance. I am also not trying to project my own "Disney" fantasy onto a girl. I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into? I simply give them what they want. And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.* **Takeaways** -Submissive girls are fun. -Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours. Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive. -Not every girl is going to walk this path. Release those back into the wild. -With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).** -Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)** ^1 In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow. Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue. ^2 Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever). Dont over plan. ^3 Mild condescension is ok. Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.

I'm just surprised a Chad wanted to sleep with an ugly girl. Is this because it's a conservative country where Stacies refuse to have sex, so Chads go sleep with ugly girls? I grew up in Canada and here Chads would not try to sleep with ugly girls, not even for easy sex. They could just get a Stacy girlfriend and she would have sex with them. It was only ugly guys who tried to pump and dump ugly girls because they couldn't always get sex from Stacies so they started to look for ways to find shameful sex.
Weight only matters if you have a pretty bone structure. If youre truly ugly, being skinny/fit only makes you fuckable and not girlfriend material (lookup r/ butterface). Besides, there are places in the world where being thin is not that exalted. Ive been bullied my entire life for being too skinny, here in Brazil, man generally gravitates towards curvy woman.
If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen. You're insecure and you need to fix that primarily. 1. You should have already been cultivating multiple women in the first place. 2. She may monkey branch, and that's just life. Get more chicks and realize that she's not yours, it's just your turn.

They want our money and peace of mind. I say, come and get it!
The outcomes and process are generally defined by where you were when you found TRP. Let's say there are these stages: * Failing with women, goal is get women * Some success with women, but never feeling like they are in control * Success with women, failed LTR/marriage that reset them to beta or otherwise damaged their view of the sexual marketplace * Tons of success with women, but no clue what to do except spin plates forever, feeling of nihilism * Any of the above, but general disgust with current sexual dynamics searching for a way out You are number 5, our "modern phenomenon" user. Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't "worse", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool. This is not a NAWALT argument. Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego. The problem is not "them being whores". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT. The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity. Lifes too short to call women whores. Lifes too short to even care. Your attitude should be "fuck it" and you will be surprised where you end up - it will probably be somewhere close to what you originally wanted.
How is this pussy pass, if any thing the other dude is screwed over
This is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.
Part of me feels bad for these women as its just in their nature to fuck up their chances with men later on. They simply cant help it. Maybe there are a select few who dont completely fuck up their chances and keep a low count & find a decent guy to marry but the majority cant help but jump on the CC during their prime years and waste their chance at something real. Even then, women still come with a whole host of issues that are just impossible to tolerate. Its just the way their brains are wired. Im so grateful to be a man
I get it. A woman who isn't psycho / bipolar, knows how to cook, is financially responsible, has a clean home / car, is not obsessed with social media, has a steady job, etc. A real science fiction blockbuster!
The anger is part of the acceptance process though innit? Although I agree that you cant be mad forever. Women are women, and theyre going to women. No point in hating them for it, best to understand why they do what they do, then exploit that knowledge for your own gain. Dont hate a sloot just cause shes a sloot. If youre not gonna fuck her, why do you care? The only guys that stay mad forever are the ones that dream about getting married. Depending on what country youre from thats akin to financial suicide, and for some thats a tough pill to swallow.
Remember to work out your hymen muscle ladies, keep it nice and strong for your man.
Stacies are everywhereI leave the house and anywhere I look, I see pretty girls. Is2g they are everywhere, Idk how they got so lucky and I am one of the rare uggos looking like . Germany is full of Stacies. Then I am like yeah understandable no one would be interested in me.

Below are 50 non-misogynistic examples:
The only reason I had a happy high school experience as an ugly woman is because 1) the woman around me saw me as no competition (there was a great deal of grief over the few town bicycles) and 2) in general, the lack of sexual tension allowed us to relate to one another without feeling like we were competing for male favor. It's pretty awful. You know what those studies say - boys benefit from being around girls; boys are detrimental to girls' education in turn
Hi! I dont grow up in a super conservative household, but I guess thought I should answer anyway. My family is catholic, so theres that. But my parents never made me think sex was a bad thing. Weve always tried to look at it in a positive, healthy light. Except I think Im asexual too. So in my experience, although Ive grown up thinking sex was a natural thing, it hasnt changed my attitude towards sex, and me not wanting it or feeing sexual attraction. Also, you can still be heteromantic! Which means double dates and romantic things with a partner are still something you can do while being asexual. Sorry if this isnt written very well, its a reply on the go! Good luck and feel free to ask more questions
It do be pretty majestic!
This is excellent thank you!
The hot guys she goes after arent interested in settling down. She doesnt want the men who do want to get married.
Can't link directly because Twitter randos, but it's the same old story. Someone created a viral tweet mocking the artist, the SJdub then dogpiled the artist. The person who started it got pushback from normal people and then claimed victimhood on the grounds of immutable characteristics. Then BitC wrote about it. Edit: Original artist has not backed down or apologized. Her tweet is still up. https://twitter.com/SakimiChanArt/status/1152040832985436166?s=19 (NSFW)
Omg I need to try this
Paywall, but if we're looking at the numbers from this year, well, yeah. Because all our weddings were cancelled...

Perfect. Ill DM you
Lmao it's funny because the main character,Greg Heffley has a very incely personality. I loved these books as a kid,still do.
From recent changes I'd say -Geo +Gotcha and -Goga +Cryn were quite bad, whether they were the worst overall idk, they were the worst in the last 6 months for sure.
no.
> I shower twice a day Theres your problem. Not enough showers. Inkwells must shower at minimum 3 times a day, sometimes even 4 depending on how good your personality had been the day before.
Nah you aren't screwed, as long as you can get her out on another date, and go to somewhere more intimate so you are close together (rather than constantly being separated by a table etc) Honestly I think this detail gets overlooked but it's really effective
A guy once wrote a friend of mine my dick would look so good inside you I guess this is what he meant!
That's literally the point... haha
I tend to have trouble keeping my attention on games for long periods of time unless theyre online / multiplayer. But I played octopath on release for about 90 hours. Did all the side quests and everything. That never happens.
**OYS 40** Age 64 Ht 5'11" Wt 170 Wife 66 Married 43 Together 46 **Physical** I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy. **Mindset** After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various "victim" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long. **Relationship** Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and "gaming", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident. I had to consciously up the comfort, touch and praise. By Sunday it seemed like things were back to normal. And I'm taking my meditation time and practice with a renewed diligence.

Extremely go fuck yourself I know what you're talking about and there's a time to discuss it, but you are in the wrong place for this conversation considering everything she's gone through and still has to go through in the coming hours, days, weeks, .... years... dec.... Read the fucking room.
39???
That hurts my vagina and I dont even have a vagina
Agreed
Tact is an underrated skill which you lack. Being too aggressive makes you come off as desperate in situation 1. You pussied out in # 2. Timing makes a difference.
I do this too - or I wait a few days after seeing something I really like. If Im still thinking about it days after seeing it, then Ill allow myself to get it if its within my budget. I also try to visualise how itll fit in with my existing wardrobe. A few people I know have real issues with stress/ impulse online shopping, so this unsubscribing technique is a good behaviour retraining exercise for them. After doing this for a week so far I barley get anymore promotional/ sales emails. Some have been from shops I never shop at anyhow, so easy to let go of those
She reached out to you man, just go for it. Try snapping her funny things. I snapped this girl I've been talking to part of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgh0nSkIy04) from Cast Away with the caption "social distancing got me like" and it sparked a conversation. Feel free to use it if you want lol
LTR hits me with When are we getting married?Been seing this girl for almost a year exclusively, and before anyone asks why im in a relationship, well, I promoted her after plating 3 different ones. This is a keeper.. for now atleast. Shes always been keen on having me move in with her, asks around about serious stuff which Ive always just laughed off or avoided all together. However this morning she hits me with the When are we getting married? bomb. She had a grin on her face and had this false joke of a tone which instantly gave away that she was indeed 100% serious. Now, Im obviously laughing in my head and I couldnt possibly go down that road so I told her We can do it whenever you want, I just need to notify my other girlfriends and see if they are okay with me settling down. Afterwards I would just dodge the bullet, but I have a feeling shes always gonna be looking for my ultimate commitment both by moving in with her and ultimately marrying her, which I obviously have no intention of doing. Is there a way to keep these comfort tests fed without having to actually give in to such nonsense? Do I give her a false idea that I actually will marry her one day?
fuckboy
Comments on that tweet brings something very important: The "Guybrush paradox" (I refuse to call it a theory). Whereas Guybrush can be flawed, a sex-changed version Galbrush couldn't without copious amount of outrage. I say, that's true in the west. But I usually consume media from the east. (Japan, Korean and Chinese comics/shows). They are not affected by that issue at all. Take for example One Punch Man. You got a woman that's crazy OP in the top S ranks, and also a sister that acts as gatekeeper of lower ranks. They have different character traits, flaws and ideals. Or Shield Hero. You got high ranking nobles (in a matriarchy) abusing their powers, and at the same time others who aren't. You got average people and slaves. Men or womens, doesn't matter. And of it's been teased that enemies from their invasion waves have at their heads heroes which we have seen 4: a male samurai, a male reaper, a female arch mage, and a female dagger/fan user. Very varied female representarton all around. Or Bofuri. Main cast is mainly female. One of the rival guild has a female guildmaster who has no confidence in herself. Maple's a dim-witted idiot who'se habit of EATING the obstacles on her way somehow made her the most powerful being imaginable... But she's still a naive idiot under the Demon Lord appearance. In Soul Land (Korean manwha/show), there's a varied amount of males and females all different, with flaws and all, and the discrimination is based entirely on if they're humans or magical beasts, or class warfare. Womens are pretty powerful in that story. But if you would try those shows here, they would all be criticised for their depictions of womens. Because outrage scammers needs to scam so that their blackmail gives them another paycheck on their patreon.
If you ever hear someone say that, just tell them that standing to pee is a bad habit by default for men, it's not some privilege of ours and should be stopped. It's been proven that naturally we're built to pee standing, and it's way healthier for dudes.
If this is at a university you can always file a title IX complaint.
"Have you ever met a real life woman before?" I'm guessing the answer is not "Yes." And most women still shave their legs and pits. If you don't like women who choose not to conform to that particular requirement, you can look for one of the many more who do shave.

[Drama] Sophia N. - "Dying Light made a harmless tweet, but now the pronoun police are losing their shit cuz we can no longer have fun with slogans. It's now deleted but if you search for @dyinglightgame you see nothing but anger. Game devs, stop giving in to the rage of all these unhappy fucks."
Looks like you're french and in SF. I am both of those things too. T'as l'air d'avoir ton game au point, mais si jamais t'as besoin d'un wingman ou de quelqu'un pour te hold accountable et te pousser approcher, c'est avec plaisir.
Women have rights, therefore I am a dour anime boy. Never before have I witnessed such succinct logic.
Agreed, how could this satire site get facts wrong??
Link?
Focus on who you want to be. What do you want to look like? What's your ideal life? Then break that down into the different areas - looks, athleticism, career, family. Start with looks - do you want grimey teeth and to weigh 130kg? No? Then brush your teeth twice a day and start weight loss. There are steps you can take for each one, you just need to focus on you and don't make it all about your virginity. PS Also fellow misophonia sufferer here and it's the absolute worst thing. It is almost impossible to describe to non-sufferers how it impacts your life. Happy to talk about it if you need any support.
Its called Hoop.
What kind of music do you listen to?I really enjoy Folk, Jazz, Bedroom Pop, Indie, R&B/Soul, Bluesy stuff. Ive always wondered if there is a certain kind of music that really suits this lifestyle, or makes you feel especially feminine and beautiful.
Most of the time when we discuss gender stuff and porn, the arguments boil down to, "What I like is good and what I dislike is bad." Human sexualities are stupid complicated and essentially everyone has their own unique set of preferences for body types and personality, kinks, and turn offs. It's not really a place where there's much to debate about specifics. There's only a few generalizations that can really be made, like pedophile porn being clearly bad since it actually hurts the children involved.
Hmm... This short guy (who definitely can't get a girlfriend because he's short btw) sure looks happy considering he's dating a gross ogre.
Some will, there are plenty of opposition media outlets that would jump on this. If the leading narrative media doesnt want to report something because it doesnt conform to their standards of what is right/wrong. GO to opposition, even if you dont agree with those people on other things.
fakecel fags that like to fucking larp that they are incel are the most pathetic pieces of trash I've come across
For me, everybody's like, "there she is!," or "ask her out!," or "get her number, quick!", but I always respond with "uh, no, I'm not that kind of person. I want to say hi and get to know her first. I don't want to be known as one who overburdens girls with requests or demands or thrusts upon her suddenly such duties in the first five or so minutes." Oh and if your do wanna have sex \[insert girl's name here\], I'm Christian so wait.
Anyone else feel that the word mother shouldnt be used in these cases? What a monster.
This is pure speculation, but I think Reddit's demographics are skewed far younger. The people on 4chan either moved on from the platform or matured it while Reddit keeps seeing an influx of teens and very young adults.
