# Prompt Engineering

Tested our Discord bot with two prompt engineering methods.

One was a short prompt that contained a short brief about the policy with no examples in order to allow the LLM to come up with its decision on the labeling.

Another one was a longer prompt which contained a longer brief about the policy with 50 misogynistic and 50 non-misgyonistic examples fed into the LLM.
