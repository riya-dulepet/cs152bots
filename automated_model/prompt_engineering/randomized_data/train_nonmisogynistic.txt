Be cool with people in general. Women are just a subset of that group.

how mgotw and redpill made me fearful of women and how I got out.Howdy ladies and gentlemen. First of all I want to say that I never was an outright member of both movement. I agreed with some concepts and while I never fully drank the koolaid, it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology, I can finally say that I got it all out of my system. I write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that I've dealt with. # The beginning It all started when I was about 17/18-ish. During this time I used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there I would sometime read about people being screwed over, relationship wise. At the time I just thought "shit happens", but those posts would come again every now and then. My downfall really started on quora and reddit. A big difference between 9gag and these 2 Websites was that the posts didn't have character limits. Quora questions like "how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you" and subreddits like r/Relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people (usually men) would be cheated on in the worst way possible. I remember how I would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious. My current situation was as follows: Overweight, virgin, no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low. Just to make you understand how bad it was, I loathed and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and I almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone. # The redpill and mgtow This is when I started to discover the redpill. I watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits. In the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened. They said that Women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it, and everywhere I looked, I would just find more stories that would confirm what I've read and heard from this redpill people. Even though I was deep in the red pill, I still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group. You see, while I believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff, I still couldn't buy the "all women are like that" mentality, both from a logical but also an emotional point. i.e. the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men, but I never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators (as far as i'm concerned). I also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them I would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say. She would often spend money on him, she took interest in what he did, etc. If my sister was like that then it wouldn't have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed. To be completely honest I wasn't angry at women, I was scared of them. I was scared that I could be cheated on, that if I got married, they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and I would have raised a child that was not mine. To give you an example of how deep my paranoia went, I often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house, trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner's back just to be sure that I wouldn't not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over. # How I got out Well, to be completely honest it was a multitude of things. First thing first, I deleted reddit and quora. This places were tainted to me and even nowadays I get somewhat nervous if I enter these websites. The next step was actually going my on way. Instead of listening to bitter and resentful people, I slowly began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own. I started to hit the gym (lost 21 kg / 46 pounds) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt. More importantly, I started to be critical of my own beliefs. If I didn't have a sound logic to it, it had to go. Now I'm 20 and I'm far more calm and retrospective person. I'm still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend, but that's just what it is. I learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services. On Monday I will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest, I'm already shitting my pants, but at least now I know that I have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me. cheers. EDIT: I called. It went good. Nothing official because of the current situation, but I'm confident I will get the place. Cheers.
That look like the same lady that was in a different thread here intentionally spitting all over the elevator buttons !
Thank goodness for it being an 'or' and not an 'and'
This is great I'm 100% going to use this.

It's just true cumbrain nature being expressed. All males have a primitive hatred for ugly women. But most males can date women that are up to their standards more or less and so they just ignore ugly women's existence instead of attacking them. But some are sexually frustrated because they can't get the 7/10 they want and are forced to settle for a 6.5. Those guys feel the need for an outlet for their frustration online. It's telling just how much of online content is dedicated to scrutinizing women's facial bones and the size of the fat sacks on their chest. Truly the rational sex, focusing on the issues that matter :D
Tell him it all depends on what the last guy whose cum she swallowed had for lunch that day. If it was pineapple, she'll fart less than if it was chili. And then back off verrrrry carefully and close the door on your way out ;)
I think it makes a huge difference. I definitely think I look far more attractive with my chest up, back straight and chin never looking down when I'm talking/walking.
Yess. I like my workplace bc its mostly women. Its just a supportive and understanding energy all around. I dont feel anxious about being judged or anything
and what ISTP so low for??
She must've done something wrong to have cops in the house. Im pretty sure they need a Warrant to come in, or atleast probable cause.
I think the thinking behind the book is "this strategy worked on a couple women, now let's try it on the whole population" or just cashing in on men who want help improving their confidence talking to women by offering it like a miracle cure. Either way, I think the best thing for you to do is to put away the books and talk to her like you used to. Remember the guy she wanted to text was the real you, without all those rules you started to follow. Good luck!
Right answer: neither can you.
Ive listened to the audio book a few time. Honestly a great listen and good practical advice that will yield result if acted on.
It looks like it's supposed to be in a scientific context as she states she has a bachelor's in medicine and a bachelor's in surgery, but that makes things all the more concerning
Just women's BS double standards. All identity groups are hypocritical. It's only a problem when the identity hypocrisy crap is weaponized and reified as a Politics instead of a sociological phenomenon. This is the whole problem with all forms of IP. They all politicize and weaponize the irrational BS of the identity group and create politics, rules, and even laws based on the egotistical lies of the ethnic group. IP is politics based on pure lies. This is why it is bad in all forms. The female hypocritical BS noted by OP is just women's politics or feminism and shows why feminism along with all other IP's is so toxic, dishonest, and dangerous. People can never be honest about themselves due to the ego roadblock. The exact same problem exists in all IPs, which are nothing more than conglomerations of the collective egos of groups that share an idhentity. These groups are susceptible to all the irrationalities of individual egotism. IP is simply egotism writ large.
The subreddit wasn't created by me, but r/menkampf definitely has the same ring to it. Although it's only dedicated to FDS.
Well, Im aware but thanks anyways.
Yep. Sometimes l, like you said, after judgement has already been made. There is an effect and I can't remember the term, but it has something to do with presenting your version of a story first to the masses even though it's untrue and just continue to hammer it in. Then the truth comes out, and although acknowledged, the masses still flock to the first version. Hope I laid this out correctly.
Theyll happen. And theyll continue to get more sophisticated. As for the actual ethics I think thats one hell of a thorny issue, primarily because theyll continue to get more human as the technology gets better. Is that a good thing? Probably not. I agree that its not going to make the problem of objectification any better. But as for whether it WILL happen? Have you ever met a human being? Once that cats outta the bag itll be impossible to put back in. The whole conundrum will need hella rules to keep it from becoming a nightmare. As to what those rules are, thats up to smarter people than me to figure out.
Good fuck the s*n

So the game didn't have this at launch. Valve invested time making sure the game ran smoothly in Proton. Linux users bought the game because it worked nicely on Linux. Then they add DAC 2 weeks later, making the game unplayable on Linux. People ask for refunds and the requests are denied, even though they can't use the product they've paid for. It's credit card charge back time. I actually wish I'd bought the game so I could complain to the ACCC. Would love to see them fuck Bethesda, id, and Denuvo.
Im more amused by the fact that he felt the need to make that weird flex in the first place. Like..... dude women are different isnt code for tell me how much you lift bro.

Awareness of the laws is key NOT actually using them to your benefit. The historical examples were very insightful and generally from less well known episodes of history.

Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city. I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity. I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth. I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago. Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men. I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily. Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted. A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time. I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned: \- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness. \- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity. \- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with. \- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles. \- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood. \- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood. \- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women. \- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc. \- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities. \- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc. \- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice. \- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play. \- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina. \- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us. \- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible.

I found Sarah Thereses YouTube channel after a whole bunch of feminists were upset about her being pro-life and loving her husband.https://www.youtube.com/user/SarahHeartsSparkle Its awesome, very self improvement focused and life style orientated. She has a emphasis on being feminine. She is a young Wife and mother of 3 children.
Yeah- I'm 5'5" and wear a size 6.5. Tiny feets- but I think they are cute. Little hands, too.
