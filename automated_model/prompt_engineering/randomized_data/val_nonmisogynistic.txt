Has this person heard of stuff like post partum depression? Very happy and mentally stable indeed.
The men deserve an award
He might have a chemical imbalance. Make sure he doesn't go on antidepresseants from what i hear they only make people worse. He might be low on T so try to convince him to take TRT. It really might help him. Higher testestrone naturally makes a man happy. From there just keep him by your side and show him what he's been missing in the world
Here is a [good article](http://marco-lopes.com/articles/Vim-and-Haskell-in-2019/) about setting up vim and Haskell: . If you use VS code, it should be similar, maybe a bit easier. In case you are learning the language, you may not need a full IDE now. Just normal setup with syntax highlight is good enough IMHO. You also can use ghcid to get fast feedback loop when development. Hope this helps!
He hit the brakes hard asf
I kind of am in the same situation, and lose interest in pursuing other girls since most things are great with one particular girl. I wonder if some people are just not made to fuck all the women available to them. Not a bad thing imo
I am THOROUGHLY confused bc she's stunning??? like objectively??? for sure, tho, the male OP is hideous like that's a no brainer lmao
Wow!
[News] Ex-Gawker editor sues Daily Beast over story portraying her as racist
Same here, when you are ugly people are less likely to approach you first, so you miss out on a lot of social interactions unless you have the guts to talk to people first, which I don't lol
I looked at her Twitter... she has a livestream, which she announces not with an image related to the serious subject at hand, but of a makeup-enhanced selfie of her looking at herself smugly. The Tweet above is clearly DRIPPING with projection. Kids these days are turds, especially the pretty girls. The Internet is the end of civilization.
Not sure I'm part of the redpill (advice)I'm a male in my very early 20s. I've only been in 1 relationship before (intentionally). I dont believe in sleeping around with random women going clubbing and things like that. I'm a reserved man. After my 1st relationship ended a while ago I've been looking into the redpill ideology. A lot of it did make sense to me , and I saw some aspects of mistakes I made in my 1st relationship which made me lean to it. However I've been through reddit and I've seen some women and a some men totally against TRP. I have a date after this lockdown ends.. and I aim in implementing some of the redpill techniques (not all) . What advice do you guys have? Whether man or woman
I would act like those guys if it was a 13y/o boy talking about dating a 25y/o woman. It's not men being aware of the danger - it's common sense.
And you post in witchesvsPatriarchy. https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/ghqvkj/what_is_your_opinion_of_blood_magic Because of course.
I don't think this counts as a "hot take" per KiA rules. Reporting on something that happened on Twitter? Anyway, that's John "White Phosphorus" Phipps she's quoting there.
Because childbirth isn't hard enough we now have to trigger my motion sickness?!?

Joker was not a DCEU film, it was seperate from the DCEU That is DC's and WB biggest folly is the fact there is no single Cinematic universe they are building like Marvel did The TV shows are separate from Films, and not even all the films are set in the same universe And up until recently not even all the shows were set in the same universe, they did kind of haphazardly attempt to pull them all together though finally,
The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of "no innocents" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and "reminded" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. The "protection money" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office... At which point donations are made to the campaign. Really.... You can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles. The 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all Tony Soprano was basically the coming of age, angsty teenager stage. It matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now.
Full disclosure, I am not the red pill type and stumbled across this post. I am however a mother of two and I feel your struggle so hard. Mine are 8 and 5 and it does get better as they grow and gain some independence. You'll find time more time for yourself and your partner. You're breastfeeding and running a household, that's an enormous amount of work and it's a 24/7 job. Feeling like you're a failure or losing yourself is normal, it happens to us all but it's not a part of motherhood that's openly discussed. I do worry about you mentioning frequent breakdowns. Have you been screened for post partum depression or anxiety? Your OBGYN should be able to help. For practical advice, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. I mean for everything. Make a couple of hours a week after the baby is in bed for you and your husband. Take some you time. Even if its getting up fifteen minutes earlier to enjoy a cup of coffee alone. Those alone minutes can be the difference between staying calm and losing your shit entirely. If you're able, hire a babysitter one night a month for a date with hubby. Remember it's okay to ask for help. I waited until my youngest was three to hire a nanny and she's a godsend. Her creativity and input is well worth every penny I've spent and she's become an invaluable part of our family. And finally, this to shall pass. All of the struggles you have are temporary and you'll be okay. Your baby will be okay if you're not perfect and so will hubby. Don't compare yourself to other moms or families. You're doing great. Also, it's totally okay to hide in the bathroom and cry for a minute when it's overwhelming.
That's awful because when I hear that song I think of how I was living in NYC at the time and the Mets used that as their Subway Series anthem. It brings back happy memories. To know it's a song putting down women like me... :(
Freedom is one of the best things a man can buy, but many men don't buy it, and we can see the results right now, when many guys are looking at their empty bank accounts and wishing we hadn't spent the stupid money we did. Personally my #1 thing is that I wish I hadn't gotten married, but I did, cause I was an idiot, and I have paid. The value of money and the misuse of it are major themes today. Men who can control their money, instead of letting their drives control them, will better succeed. If it flies, floats, or fucks, it's more than you should spend.
Yuri in her poems had complex words I think she likes philosophy and fantasy
If a girl went cold suddenly after constantly texting and gets back after 2 days. Does it come across as butthurt or immature to take the same amount of time to respond?I actually got needy at some stage and send a needy text and later I recovered by posting stories on Instagram and I think she got back sensing that I was not needy after 2 going cold for 2 days.
As a South Asian woman who moved to Europe, I can relate to how you feel. In my home country, I come across as 'ultra-modern', and in my country of residence, it took me two years to exactly grasp what 'subtle sexism' as opposed to 'overt sexism' looks like. I find it difficult to discuss my issues in the feminist groups I've been part of - their solutions would not touch on the nuances of culture that I experience. Online, Reddit as a whole is very US-centric. What has helped me was to join some women-centric groups from my home country - these are not naturally feminist groups, but they give a sense of relatedness. I also follow some accounts on IG from the expat communities. This helps me feel that I'm not alone in my struggles. I think you should still state your struggles - and open up the broader discussion that feminism and sexism are at different stages around the world. Happy to lend a listening ear anytime you want.
I've seen bottles of the 107 and 12 for $250 and $300
He seems to be, but that flair was given long ago, and not meant to be positive. People didn't love his dark triad post. I did. I Patrick Bateman'd my wife thanks to MCT.
The only things that helped me was ice cold sparkling water and small but frequent meals. Never let yourself get hungry, but don't have big meals.
Nah, I don't live with her. We only see each other at school at the moment, and we make use of the short moments where there are no teachers around to yell at us to keep our 1.5m of distance. Removing attention, either via digital communication or spending free time at school with my mates instead of her could be good starting points, thank you
