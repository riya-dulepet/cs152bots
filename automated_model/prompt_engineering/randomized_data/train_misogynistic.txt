They want equality but dont want to touch that provider gender role that is forced on men.
Shouldve tased her entitled ass.
>I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Just when I've been thinking to myself, "hey, I'm gaming my wife and having the sex that I want to have. I'm owning my shit, keeping my house in order and leading..." The new kitchen island just got delivered this week, and the new fridge arrives on Friday. Solid post.
Women arent smart.
I know that the US is full of hot people. People say Stacies and Chads are rare but I can definetely say uggos are rare in my country. Most ppl are average or above average.
Spez is a cuck, also if you n word bot him it says he used the hard R lol
That's not woman
This is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.
A Man's class depends on his job or inheritance. A Woman's class depends on the Beta Cucks she Dates. That's the truth about female nature. I don't know about All men, but every female I've ever seen has left her friends and relatives to upgrade her "Class" and "Standards" which derived in the first place because of some Rich Guy . Men are such simple minded humans and don't always "Choose" friends based on discrimination. Females are the exact opposite. The Guy above seriously needs to tell her to FUCK Off!! The class she's talking about changing in him won't even matter when she'll monkey branch on some other dude. It's his money, time and standard and he can't even have conversations with real interesting people other than the shallow WHORES? That's why MGTOW forever guys.
I found a girl with an EXTREME scarcity mindset. Is this a good or bad thing?Shes very traditional in her values. Like shes 22 and she will do ANYTHING for me, partly, because shes afraid shell never meet someone else as good as me. Is this a good or bad thing? Edit: Didnt expect the comments. Heres some feedback to clear up the situation. Im mostly asking for perspectives, not advice. 1) at first I didnt even know that the fuck a unicorn was... I had to look it up. No I dont think shes that and I dont think shes perfect. its a stretch for you to assume I did. 2) Weve been fucking for almost a year, no real intentions on LTR or marriage (some guy mentioned me pushing for marriage?). Thats a dumbass assumption and I dont know why you guys think Im trying to LTR her. 3) Yes she is BPD confirmed. For those of you who are scared shitless of BPD women, Ive maximized my benefits from out relationship. You guys just need to know how to control BPD women and dont be so fucking emotionally manipulated 4)
>I love beating women. I like to hear them scream while I leave them to die in my basement Wow OP, just wow.
It's mindblowing that everyone gets more offended when you tell some fat chick to start exercising and stop eating junk food.
Solution: team up with a Stacy and make her pose with your art then auction it.
One thing that helps understanding women- they are always *always* concerned with themselves. Their husband, their parents, even their children always come second to their own interests. Even when it seems they are doing something charitable, it is always for what they get back. I used to work with charities and women loved filling the roles as long as 1) the job was easy and especially 2) they get acknowledged for the job. They will never work anonymously. Ever. That is just how they are wired.
The sad truth is that a man is only valued by his actions, whereas a woman is valued by her looks/body, something that is inherent to her.
yup yup! It's diffucult to unlearn beauty ideals, especially when society reminds you every day that you're ugly. but I love faking confidence. And I notice musty men and Stacys alike fuming when I do Stacy's think "stay in your place, only I should feel good about myself and enjoy privileges. uglies need to stay at the bottom of the hierarchy and suffer the most from sexism/lookism." Men just can't deal with the fact that their lack of attraction to you doesn't make you stay quiet and actually demand respect
Feminists are the cause of this discrimination in the first place.
Hit her the fuck back, ya pussy
>Illimitable Men << 3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok. >> The other OK option is if you are the Hiphopopotamus: *My rhymes are so potent that in this small segment* *I made all of the ladies in the area pregnant* *Yeah, sometimes my lyrics are sexist* *But you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this*
I'm just here to make fun of the mentally unstable and aging party whores.
Sounds like bullshit. Women are programmed to know they can get more. Thats why once you start hitting on a 4-5 she turns into the biggest slut because you made her realize someone wants to fuck her so others will want to as well. Shes is playing you for a sucker
please stop valuing the opinion of men you see onlinethis is not a typical "feel good" post. this is a reminder. **TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.** if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value. men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that. but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better. I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women. these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s. so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked. also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks. so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.
I would say you have three possible options. Rookie, intermediate, and advanced. Which option you choose is strictly up to your level of confidence. Rookie: pick her up from work and when you see the guy, just give him a stare. Say nothing. Give him a handshake and crush his hand during the handshake. Say "is this the fat faggot you were telling me about?" This path is a little insecure but if fatty is a pussy he will fuck off Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat. If she is jealous of other girls than she will be nervous and trying to please you. What do you think?
This is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.
Weight only matters if you have a pretty bone structure. If youre truly ugly, being skinny/fit only makes you fuckable and not girlfriend material (lookup r/ butterface). Besides, there are places in the world where being thin is not that exalted. Ive been bullied my entire life for being too skinny, here in Brazil, man generally gravitates towards curvy woman.
Problem is women have most men's favorite treat, pussy. I moved to Latin America and it's easily available so I'm not controlled by it as much as a lonely man in a house in the suburbs of America. I'm not marrying these hoes, just pumping them. I rent once a week,
Legit I love the bitch he adds at the end it most likely frustrates her further which makes me happy prick gets what she fucking deserves
The worldwide hive mind is spot fucking on. Women can't ever be happy at the top of their local social hierarchy anymore, now they hear stories of other middle aged women like MacKenzie Bezos and Janet Jackson on down to Becky down the block divorce raping their hubbies around the world, stealing all the cash, and riding off into the sunset on Tyrone's dick to go shopping forever. The divorce industry keeps profiting and families keep disintegrating by selling these bored housewives a false hope of winning the divorce lottery, all it costs them is everything they built and to hell with the collateral damage. Imagine how many families could be saved if the global hivemind competition was curtailed?
This is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.
Wow. That girl is real ugly. Very inappropriate
OMG Some are so distasteful that I don't even want to genderswap them ... I don't even want to say this as exopsing satire ... yikes...
Mods PLEASE. BAN STACIES/BECKIES/NORMIES FROM MAKING THREADS
Really bizarre sub. I some times peruse it because some of the more sane posts sometimes have helpful insights into the female experience. On one hand they fucking hate men. It is straight-up sexism that would not stand if the genders were reversed. On the other hand 99% of them seem to not get the irony that they consider themselves a catch, yet they mostly shitpost about getting as much dick in themselves as possible. On the front page right now there is a post ranting about how the OP is taking dick from "three different low value males" and how that empowers her while waiting for a "high value male". I'm no expert but the sort of guy that they consider the gold standard is either going to be married or smart enough not to pay attention to the kind of people who post on that sub. &#x200B; Like, the mental gymnastics in that sub would win gold at the olympics.
Is Shelia Szas a nympho??
See this? See this shit? I hate this how this is portrayed by women, trying act smarter than men. Sickening. I used to read great comics and all of them had great plot and story. And almost none of them involved women. I would need to find old comic books that doesnt involved the vast amount of stupidity of women.
Women hate men who know what they are like, because they know how evil they are themselves, thats why they hate on each other. Stick to your thoughts, dont let em guilt you out of your thoughts.
Fuck that piece of shit bitch
Breakups are fun, you get to move onto new pussy.
"Childish" to women is a man doing too many things that don't directly benefit a woman. If he isn't serving a woman or piling up resources a woman can land on when she's bucked off the cc, he's being childish. Peter Pan. It's especially objectionable to them if he's doing it with other guys, thereby preventing them from doing something that serves women. When a man is doing something he detests that serves the interests of a woman (and her children), that's when he's being least childish in their eyes. That's when he's a good man. That's when he's a 'real man'. Self-sacrifice in order to give her what she wants but doesn't need and shouldn't accept. But they still won't fuck him much. They prefer fuckbois to 'real men'.
Exposing the toxic side of r/FemaleDatingStrategyHey guys, I recently set up a sub owned by u/Rahvenar called r/M4leDatingStrategy. We want to help use this sub to expose the toxic, sexist, and extremely insecure female incels on the sub. To do so all you have to do is go on r/FemaleDatingStrategy and genderswap all the crazy shit the women there post. Keep in mind I'm a female too and I had enough of these bitches giving us other women a bad rep. Thanks in advance!
Love this kind of shit. All of the fantasies women love to portray about themselves, really speak about their real life inadequacies. Like captain marvel being the strongest avenger. She's only portrayed that way because in reality, women are weaker than men. Or that black female wakanda scientist in infinity war who was portrayed to be smarter than both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner combined. It was portrayed that way because in reality, men are usually more intelligent than women. One reason we know that women are weak and stupid is because fantasy and comic books portray the opposite.
TBH its nice playing blue pill with these women sometimes. She even paid for my meal and a train ticket.
This is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.
I pity the kid who literally can't get away from the fact that his mom is a thot. Even if your family moves to another state your classmates might already recognize her the day you move in.
1. Who cares about this worthless bitch. Consign her to the trash and shes easily replaceable. 2. Sorry to hear about your dad. Yes, you have to get on with it as when one of us falls, another man must pick up his burden. But there will be real pain and grief, and youll have to find a way to deal with that. Take as long as you need, and focus on rebuilding your life and supporting your family emotionally. About the girl: good riddance.
IMO, it's the lack of fathers. We live in an increasingly male disposable world. There's a very large swath of women that are very vocal about the optionality of fathers. Combine this with the lack of male role models in school (outside of an occasional teacher/coach), and we begin to see how they don't value men.
Chonk bitch
Facetime? Are you kidding me?I left this sub for some time cause of seeing excessive amounts of useless advice. I came back recently to see if people are actually still hooking up through dating apps / how they are doing so, but I keep seeing posts on "How to do a Facetime call?" or "How to talk to a girl over text?" or "Why aren't girls answering my texts?" Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how much of a waste of time that is? Do you know you're being used? Girls thrive on attention and you're giving them that, especially at a time like this. Seriously, stop it. I see some people claiming they've already made "5-6 dates possible for after the quarantine." Yeah, right cause the first person a girl wants to see after a quarantine is a random fucking stranger they "met" on a dating app, Jesus Christ. There's no guarantee you'll meet a girl after the quarantine is over and the quarantine isn't gonna be over anytime soon. You're being delusional and naive. There's no treatment for COVID-19 and there won't be a vaccine for another 12-18 months and yet we're acting like the situation right now is a temporary one, it's not. Get used to it. Either you're making actual moves and meeting people (obviously not in a crowded area), and accept youre taking a risk, or you're not. If you choose not to, then enjoy texting and Facetiming for the next few months-year and watch it take you nowhere. Wake up. Please. Edit: Don't be in denial. Normal life won't resume anytime soon.

Tell me about it. All the entitlement with no responsibility. this is why the patriarchy was the best social system ever. Women and children need adult male authority to be kept in check. Don't believe me? Look at the anarchy all around For anyone interested, join our mgtow discord. Link in the first pinned post on my reddit profile.
