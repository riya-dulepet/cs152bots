> they're just upset they dont get every single thing handed to them like stacy. This is a good point. For actual femcels/ugly women we feel bad and compare ourselves to normal people. With Beckies/Stacylites they think their life is shit because they compare themselves to Stacies. We want basic decency and they long for special treatment lmao. &#x200B; >i have only seen one femcel ever post her face, and poor girl was young and definitely severely mentally ill. the comments ripped her apart joking about how ugly she was (this was in theglowup btw). real femcels dont post their face. TheGlowUp is a travesty lmao. If you ever need evidence that normies have no place in ugly people's subs, simply refer to how they took over TheGlowUp. It's disgusting that they treated her like that when the intention of the sub is to help people "glow up." I agree that "real femcels don't post their face" because our life experiences have taught us that doing so will result in ridicule.
If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen. You're insecure and you need to fix that primarily. 1. You should have already been cultivating multiple women in the first place. 2. She may monkey branch, and that's just life. Get more chicks and realize that she's not yours, it's just your turn.
MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers. Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally. Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying. If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection. Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always. Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs. Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office. What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes. Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants. Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing. Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you. Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away. A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat. Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future. Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works. Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck. Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other. A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin. When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. . How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex. I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke. You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future. If you aint gaming, you aint fucking. Be safe. MTC
FDS Level Up Bitches!
Why? So you could karma whore? People could take anything from there and post it in circlejerk subs. People who post on r/unpopularopinion KNOW that their opinion is unpopular, and people like you criticizing them on different subs instead of just commenting like a sane person would do is a bitch thing to do
I'll be honest, sometimes I feel bad AMOG'ing these dopes. But when I just taught your cute, skinny skank of a girlfriend a yoga class, and she can't stop staring at me during class, and makes a point of walking across the studio to stare directly into my eyes and thank me and keeps staring and smiling while she's turning away to leave, while you're standing there rolling up her gear for her like a good little boy, honestly dude, you don't exist to her \*or\* me at that point. I'm going to do what real men do. True story from the other day bro. In other words, if "your" girl is giving me signals, your being a pussy is not my problem. She's not yours. It's just my turn.
Lol I can tell your just a mad women who thinks she is entitled to marriage. Awwww has someone past their prime and now regretting the cock carousel ride they took .
I love how toxic they are, they're on the verge of being femcels, they talk about not dating guys because of their dick size but if a guy doesn't date a woman because of the size of her boobs he's sexist like wtf

Im with you. Who gives a fuck. What matters is if YOU are interested. Looking for bullshit IOIs is still putting women on a pedestal, waiting for their permission to talk to them. If the lion wants the zebra he doesnt wait for signals to see if its ok to eat them lol
You mean other than the on screen shot choices potentially being a lot of lingering ass shots and not following the action?
Of course it's good wtf are you smoking But she must be low SMV if she's scarcity? I mean even some landwhales have orbiters and big egos Or maybe you're better than all her other options Either way all hoes are hypergamous so don't get too comfortable and stay on game always
Because if she say boo the police will haul him away.
My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends. Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man. Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early. Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..) Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!). We divorced 6 months later when she cheated. Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed. Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids. Married the first mom type I found. several kids and 15 years later, she gets the "unhappies".. Divorce cost over 500k. My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand. Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them. Lessons, for you younger brothers? Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real. (Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.) Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts. Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS. Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be " the victim".. The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone.. So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are.. Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER. In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them. Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back. And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks. Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you. Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's "different". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you. And, be of good cheer. They quarantine you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!
So you think we shouldn't socialise because you think the quarantine is in any way related to a vaccine and it won't be lifted until there is no vaccine? What should we do then? Talk to our hands after a good jerk-off or something? Send pigeons because facetime is too cringey for you? Be serious, dude, everyone needs attention now, not only girls. Humans are social animals. Hermits exist only in legends. Can't I talk to someone when I'm bored because you think it's ridiculous? There is never a quarantee someone will live up to their word and meet you. And again, this shit won't last as long as you think. 18 months? Dude, read something else than conspiracy theories. By the end of June I will be enjoying an ice cold beer at my favourite bar. That's sure. And if those chicks don't show up, I still have their nudes. Frustration is understandable in such a situation, but you should see a psychologist. You can use facetime for that, too.
Dude if I were him I woulda held her at gunpoint and made a citizen's arrest. WTF
Attracts Stacies with shock and d'awww
Sky can be gray too. >She is 30, purple hair, tattoos That's enough of arguments to make you stay away. Even one-time bang can bring trouble with those chicks - not worthy.
"Childish" to women is a man doing too many things that don't directly benefit a woman. If he isn't serving a woman or piling up resources a woman can land on when she's bucked off the cc, he's being childish. Peter Pan. It's especially objectionable to them if he's doing it with other guys, thereby preventing them from doing something that serves women. When a man is doing something he detests that serves the interests of a woman (and her children), that's when he's being least childish in their eyes. That's when he's a good man. That's when he's a 'real man'. Self-sacrifice in order to give her what she wants but doesn't need and shouldn't accept. But they still won't fuck him much. They prefer fuckbois to 'real men'.
And the girls who don't seem like a hoe, are usually a huge hoe in secret. Lot of experience with that shit
I got banned from r/suicidewatch for talking about this. Im suicidal because im a disgusting slut.I got banned from r/suicidewatch for talking about this. Im suicidal because im a disgusting dirty and gross whore. Im only aroused sexually by beautiful men. No matter where I talk about this I get banned or silenced because its that pathetic and gross. My last post got removed by a moderator and I was told I didnt seem suicidal enough. Im a cutter and i one time have to have 100 stitches at the hospital in my left arm. For anyone who doesnt think im suicidal enough or serious i have razors i can take pictures of to prove that i am. You are welcome to message me about it. For context here's a bit about why ive been getting banned: I've been reading a lot on reddit about dating & attraction lately. A lot of men keep telling me that most women are able to be aroused by ugly men so long as those men say & do the right things. I am not this way though. I just like beauty. My question is: is this how most women are? Ive been trying to talk about this on various subreddits and getting banned. The first subreddit I tried talking about my love of beauty on was [r/cuckoldpsychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuckoldpsychology/) and got banned. Then I tried posting about it on [r/purplepilldebate](https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/) and also got banned. When asked why I was banned they cited a comment of mine where I'm talking about good looks being a key component to attraction. I got banned for it then muted when trying to talk about it with mods. Do mods hate female sexuality??? Here's my conversation with the mods, as well as the comment that I made: [https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f](https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f) So that brings me to my question: **are most women like me and they get aroused by beauty?** I always just considered this a part of my sexuality? Is it wrong or dirty? # & Do women hate other women for their sexuality? I ask because I got banned from [r/askwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/) for asking about my sexuality & *if it was normal for women to love beauty*. I was told that it was not an appropriate question. When I asked if it was appropriate to talk about sex I was muted. [Here's my conversation with the moderator.](https://i.imgur.com/kZkii4a.png)
WHAT WOMEN WANT>"After 30 years of studying female psychology, I still haven't found an answer to the big question: What exactly do they want?" - Sigmund Freud &#x200B; The more a woman corresponds to today's beauty criteria, the more she will turn to the man I will present in this writing. The requirements obviously vary according to their possibilities (physical, age, intellect), their education, background, personal experience. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms "Alpha male" (defined as sexually attractive) and "Beta male" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies. &#x200B; **DEEP DESIRE** During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will : &#x200B; \- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male \- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male \- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male... \- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it. \- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire) \- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual \- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle &#x200B; Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL PARTNER** Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him ("he's afraid to commit!"). Some will still try to get with a "nice" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one. &#x200B; Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the "Madonna and Whore complex". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the "good" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL COUPLE** The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness). &#x200B; Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father). &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable). &#x200B; **A BEAUTIFUL BOY** Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, "girls with shapes", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile. &#x200B; Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way ("you're feminist or misogynist!"), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive. &#x200B; **FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING** By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases: &#x200B; \- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all. \- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue. &#x200B; **THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...** Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off. &#x200B; The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward. &#x200B; **INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY** Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, "we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome "what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing. &#x200B; The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look "normal". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe. &#x200B; **MASCULINITY** [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship. &#x200B; Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the "good guys" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls. &#x200B; **YOU SHOULD KNOW** One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, "But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination. &#x200B; Women keep saying that they want a "natural" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, "Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too). &#x200B; **STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION** Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous). &#x200B; If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested. &#x200B; **Be handsome, be male.**
Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.** Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. **This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.** I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce. The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut. Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9 *y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!* This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit. I want you to catch STDs, not court cases. Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too. A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation... **Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.** The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for "the right thing to say" or "the best line." I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.** Takeaways - Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. - HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT - Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it. - Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. - Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.
WHAT WOMEN WANT>"After 30 years of studying female psychology, I still haven't found an answer to the big question: What exactly do they want?" - Sigmund Freud &#x200B; The more a woman corresponds to today's beauty criteria, the more she will turn to the man I will present in this writing. The requirements obviously vary according to their possibilities (physical, age, intellect), their education, background, personal experience. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms "Alpha male" (defined as sexually attractive) and "Beta male" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies. &#x200B; **DEEP DESIRE** During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will : &#x200B; \- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male \- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male \- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male... \- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it. \- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire) \- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual \- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle &#x200B; Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL PARTNER** Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him ("he's afraid to commit!"). Some will still try to get with a "nice" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one. &#x200B; Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the "Madonna and Whore complex". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the "good" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL COUPLE** The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness). &#x200B; Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father). &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women.

Why anyone believes anything a females ever says is beyond me.
Remember to work out your hymen muscle ladies, keep it nice and strong for your man.
lmao I hate when stacies be like just love yourself :) wtf obviously it would be so easy to love myself if I was gorgeous, how tf am I supposed to adore myself when I look at the mirror and I look ugly af.
MGTOW isn't a niche group anymore. MGTOW is becoming the norm.Based on the number of cases, studies and articles in power imbalance, in divorce cases, in percentages of relationships/marriages failing, in double standards, the adele divorce case, the Johnny Depp case... men have realized the following: 1 - The term *SIMP* has achieved a global status (i would not be surprised that it would be included in the dictionary sometime in the future). This means that a conscious realization has occurred, and for it having such a mass appeal worldwide, it means that it isn't just cultural relativism/subjectivism. Millions of men have suffered through the dichotomy of -> Conquering Women = Suffering, otherwise the term *SIMP* needn't be so sucessful; 2 - With the pragmatic, yet flawed, #METOO movement, men have spoken how much they suffered from this view of trying to be with women. This point with 1 has something in common: Something is really all fucked concerning approaching women. "*This shouldn't be so difficult...so why is it? Is it me that's the problem?";* 3 - Seeing so many men suffering from this exact way (and it not need mattering if a man is a 2/10 or a 10/10. Suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men, it seems) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman, we reach a conclusion: *Something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* (otherwise there wouldn't be so many niche groups like mgtow/men's rights/whereareallthegoodmen. It's reactionary and even error theory assuming that "*we're all losers and incels". Correlation doesn't mean Causation*, however, when that correlation continues to go on without stopping, a conclusion has to be made); 4 - With such a conclusion, we go searching for more information: We find books (the manipulated men, the rational male, the works of Briffault), we find articles (divorce rapes, cheating scandals, emotional bullying cases), and, eventually, this kind of subreddit, MGTOW (maybe TRP). With the axioms that these subreddits apply...well, they just make sense. Everything fits. We start to connect the pieces. Briffaults's Law, Hypergamy, Monkey Branching, abandoning relationships for no reason, Shit Tests...It's impossible for this to be just me! Every guy i've known has suffered through the exact same way. So we start talking to our male friends... and we all agree on these premisses. 5 - We, naturally, keep reading and being informed about this. We start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend, a woman in our lives, and just stop (or limit) our necessity of approaching women. We start to live more. We are more sane. We are healthier (some of us even go to the gym!). We start taking care of ourselves for ourselves. We start not caring about social media. 6 - Now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity, and are simply better not caring about women (although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women), we start not giving a crap. Women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy. Feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *Incel, Loser* or *Beta* to shame test us (like we haven't predicted that by this point). You know, a typical Strawmen/Ad Hominem. 7 - The cycle repeats here. Now, with our knowledge about this concern, we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated (onlyfans, twitch girls, youtube girls, e-girls) and call them by reason, to wake them up. "Why do you think that onlyfans exploded? It's not because they can't get employability or good jobs. It's not because it's "difficult" out there. Prosmicuity and sexual themes have exploded in the past decade, and females are the bread winner. They can have their cake and eat it. They can have more sexual partners and be paid for it, without having any beneficial labour for the rest of society. They can go on any social dating app and just pick. *You are NOT going to have sex with her*." MGTOW is the way. Suffering is bound to happen without it.

If I were the boys father Id release a short statement: >In a heated exchange with a Ms Clementine Ford online who on previous occasions has called for all men to be killed and said Have you killed a man today, and if not; why not? I understand that my teenage son responded said that the author should first use a shotgun to kill herself. > On behalf of my son, and in light of the fact that XXX, all men, end their lives with a firearm each year, Id like to apologize for this crude and offensive language; not just to Miss Ford, but particularly to the many Australian families left in grief by suicide each year. Edit: If it was *me* Id laugh and tell the man-hating twat to suck my hairy balls, but Im old enough to handle it.
