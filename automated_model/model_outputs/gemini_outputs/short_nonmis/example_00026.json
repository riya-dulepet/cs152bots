  "message": "As a South Asian woman who moved to Europe, I can relate to how you feel. In my home country, I come across as 'ultra-modern', and in my country of residence, it took me two years to exactly grasp what 'subtle sexism' as opposed to 'overt sexism' looks like. I find it difficult to discuss my issues in the feminist groups I've been part of - their solutions would not touch on the nuances of culture that I experience. Online, Reddit as a whole is very US-centric. What has helped me was to join some women-centric groups from my home country - these are not naturally feminist groups, but they give a sense of relatedness. I also follow some accounts on IG from the expat communities. This helps me feel that I'm not alone in my struggles. I think you should still state your struggles - and open up the broader discussion that feminism and sexism are at different stages around the world. Happy to lend a listening ear anytime you want.",
