  "message": "The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of \"no innocents\" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and \"reminded\" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. The \"protection money\" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office... At which point donations are made to the campaign. Really.... You can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles. The 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all Tony Soprano was basically the coming of age, angsty teenager stage. It matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now.",
