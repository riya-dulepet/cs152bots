  "message": "My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends. Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man. Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early. Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..) Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!). We divorced 6 months later when she cheated. Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed. Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids. Married the first mom type I found. several kids and 15 years later, she gets the \"unhappies\".. Divorce cost over 500k. My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand. Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them. Lessons, for you younger brothers? Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real. (Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.) Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts. Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS. Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be \" the victim\".. The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone.. So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are.. Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER. In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them. Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back. And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks. Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you. Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's \"different\". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you. And, be of good cheer. They quarantine you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",
