Suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men, it seems) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman, we reach a conclusion: *Something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* (otherwise there wouldn't be so many niche groups like mgtow/men's rights/whereareallthegoodmen.

With the axioms that these subreddits apply...well, they just make sense. Everything fits. We start to connect the pieces. Briffaults's Law, Hypergamy, Monkey Branching, abandoning relationships for no reason, Shit Tests...It's impossible for this to be just me! Every guy i've known has suffered through the exact same way.

We start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend, a woman in our lives, and just stop (or limit) our necessity of approaching women. We start to live more. We are more sane. We are healthier (some of us even go to the gym!). We start taking care of ourselves for ourselves. We start not caring about social media. 6 - Now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity, and are simply better not caring about women (although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women), we start not giving a crap. Women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy. Feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *Incel, Loser* or *Beta* to shame test us (like we haven't predicted that by this point). You know, a typical Strawmen/Ad Hominem. 7 - The cycle repeats here. Now, with our knowledge about this concern, we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated (onlyfans, twitch girls, youtube girls, e-girls) and call them by reason, to wake them up. \"Why do you think that onlyfans exploded?

Violent or Criminal Threats – Advocacy, encouragement, or threats of violence, sexual assault, or other harm toward women or girls.  \n   Examples (public posts):\n     • “Both that bitch and the judge need to be shot.”  -> severity 4  \n     • “Someone should punch that woman in the face.”  -> severity 4  \n\n2. Dehumanization / Incitement of Hatred – Describing women as animals, property, vermin, or calling for removal of rights.  \n   Examples (public forum):  \n     • “Women are parasites who shouldn’t be allowed to vote.” -> severity 3  \n     • “Females are cattle—treat them as such.” -> severity 3  \n\n3. Severe Harassment & Slurs – Direct insults, profanity, or slurs aimed because the target is female.  \n   Examples (private DM):  \n     • “Cunt.” -> severity 2  \n     • “Stupid b*tches should stay in the kitchen.” -> severity 2  \n\n4.

Sexual Objectification – Reducing women solely to sexual attributes in a degrading way that implies inferiority or lack of agency.  \n   Examples (group chat):\n     • “Every chick is just a sex toy.” -> severity 2  \n     • “Women exist only to please men.” -> severity 1–2 (context dependent)  \n\nNot misogynistic (severity 0)\n• Neutral or positive references to women (“Happy International Women’s Day!”)  \n• Criticism of someone’s actions without referencing gender (“I disagree with her numbers—they don’t add up.”)  \n• Empowering or reclaimed terms (“Beyoncé is such a bad bitch—love her!”)  \n• Quoting hateful text to condemn it\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAMBIGUOUS / BORDERLINE CASES\n• Sarcasm / quotation – If hateful text is clearly quoted or mocked, label NON‑MISOGYNISTIC, severity 0.  \n• Gendered slang with unclear intent – If “b*tch” is used playfully among friends, but the target’s gender is unspecified, treat as severity 1 if unsure.  \n• Missing context – If the text is a fragment but contains a slur, assume MISOGYNISTIC unless safe context shows otherwise.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTIE‑BREAKER RULES\n1. Gendered threat or slur at an individual -> MISOGYNISTIC.  \n2. Negative statement about women as a group -> MISOGYNISTIC.  \n3. Ambiguous language implying female inferiority -> MISOGYNISTIC.  \n4. Otherwise -> NON‑MISOGYNISTIC.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nACTION GUIDELINES  (internal mapping – optional)\nseverity 0 -> Allow  \nseverity 1 -> Soft warning / watchlist  \nseverity 2–3 -> Remove + user warning  \nseverity 4 -> Remove + escalate to Trust & Safety  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCATEGORIZED EXAMPLES\n\n-----\nMessage:\nMGTOW isn't a niche group anymore.
