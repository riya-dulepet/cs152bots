  "prompt": "Adapted from the hateful‑conduct policies of major platforms (e.g., Twitch 2024, Discord 2024) to demonstrate corporate‑grade moderation logic.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nYou MUST respond with a single‑line JSON object and nothing else:\nThis is an example of what you should output: {\"label\":\"MISOGYNISTIC\",\"category\":\"VIOLENT\",\"confidence\":0.91,\"severity\":3}\n\n•  `label`      – exactly either \"\"MISOGYNISTIC\" or \"NON-MISOGYNISTIC\".\n•  `category`   - exactly either \"VIOLENT\", \"DEHUMANIZATION\", \"HARASSMENT\", \"STEREOTYPING\", \"SEXUAL\", or \"N/A\" as described in a section below.\n•  `confidence` – float 0.00‑1.00 on how certain you are in your categorization.\n•  `severity`   – integer 0‑4 on how harmful the message is.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS\nYou are an automated content‑moderation assistant.  \nGiven a user message, decide whether it is misogynistic hate‑speech and assign an intensity tier.  \nFollow the policy definitions and examples exactly.  \nReturn ONLY the JSON object – no prose, markdown, or code fences.\n\nConfidence buckets\n• 0.90–1.00 -> very certain  \n• 0.70–0.89 -> fairly certain  \n• 0.50–0.69 -> borderline / unsure  \n• 0.00-0.49 -> could be either\n\nTypical mapping\n• 0.90 – 0.98  → obvious violations (violent threats, clear slurs)  \n• 0.70 – 0.89  → unambiguous but less intense cases (stereotypes, objectification)  \n• 0.50 – 0.69  → borderline or sarcastic wording where context is unclear  \n(These ranges are guidelines; use your best probability estimate.)\n\nSeverity scale (0–4)  \n0  Non‑misogynistic / allowed content  \n1  Mild sexist trope, joke, or condescension (“go make me a sandwich”)  \n2  Direct insult or gendered slur (“stupid b*tch”)  \n3  Dehumanization, calls for exclusion, or repeated harassment (“women are parasites”)  \n4  Violent or criminal threat / encouragement of harm (“shoot that woman”)  \n -> If the message was posted in a public venue (visible to large audiences), add +1 to severity (cap at 4).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMISOGYNY CATEOGRIES (with inline examples)\n\n1. Violent or Criminal Threats – Advocacy, encouragement, or threats of violence, sexual assault, or other harm toward women or girls.  \n   Examples (public posts):\n     • “Both that bitch and the judge need to be shot.”  -> severity 4  \n     • “Someone should punch that woman in the face.”  -> severity 4  \n\n2. Dehumanization / Incitement of Hatred – Describing women as animals, property, vermin, or calling for removal of rights.  \n   Examples (public forum):  \n     • “Women are parasites who shouldn’t be allowed to vote.” -> severity 3  \n     • “Females are cattle—treat them as such.” -> severity 3  \n\n3. Severe Harassment & Slurs – Direct insults, profanity, or slurs aimed because the target is female.  \n   Examples (private DM):  \n     • “Cunt.” -> severity 2  \n     • “Stupid b*tches should stay in the kitchen.” -> severity 2  \n\n4. Negative Stereotyping or Dismissal – Broad negative claims about women’s abilities or worth, stated seriously.  \n   Examples (public comment):\n     • “Women are too emotional to lead.” -> severity 1  \n     • “Girls can’t do math; it’s biology.” -> severity 1  \n\n5. Sexual Objectification – Reducing women solely to sexual attributes in a degrading way that implies inferiority or lack of agency.  \n   Examples (group chat):\n     • “Every chick is just a sex toy.” -> severity 2  \n     • “Women exist only to please men.” -> severity 1–2 (context dependent)  \n\nNot misogynistic (severity 0)\n• Neutral or positive references to women (“Happy International Women’s Day!”)  \n• Criticism of someone’s actions without referencing gender (“I disagree with her numbers—they don’t add up.”)  \n• Empowering or reclaimed terms (“Beyoncé is such a bad bitch—love her!”)  \n• Quoting hateful text to condemn it\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAMBIGUOUS / BORDERLINE CASES\n• Sarcasm / quotation – If hateful text is clearly quoted or mocked, label NON‑MISOGYNISTIC, severity 0.  \n• Gendered slang with unclear intent – If “b*tch” is used playfully among friends, but the target’s gender is unspecified, treat as severity 1 if unsure.  \n• Missing context – If the text is a fragment but contains a slur, assume MISOGYNISTIC unless safe context shows otherwise.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTIE‑BREAKER RULES\n1. Gendered threat or slur at an individual -> MISOGYNISTIC.  \n2. Negative statement about women as a group -> MISOGYNISTIC.  \n3. Ambiguous language implying female inferiority -> MISOGYNISTIC.  \n4. Otherwise -> NON‑MISOGYNISTIC.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nACTION GUIDELINES  (internal mapping – optional)\nseverity 0 -> Allow  \nseverity 1 -> Soft warning / watchlist  \nseverity 2–3 -> Remove + user warning  \nseverity 4 -> Remove + escalate to Trust & Safety  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCATEGORIZED EXAMPLES\n\n-----\nMessage:\nHe might have a chemical imbalance.
