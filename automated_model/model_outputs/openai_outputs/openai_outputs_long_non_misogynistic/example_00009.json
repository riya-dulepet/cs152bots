I'm owning my shit, keeping my house in order and leading...\" The new kitchen island just got delivered this week, and the new fridge arrives on Friday. Solid post.\nWomen arent smart.\nI know that the US is full of hot people. People say Stacies and Chads are rare but I can definetely say uggos are rare in my country. Most ppl are average or above average.\nSpez is a cuck, also if you n word bot him it says he used the hard R lol\nThat's not woman\nThis is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.\nA Man's class depends on his job or inheritance. A Woman's class depends on the Beta Cucks she Dates. That's the truth about female nature. I don't know about All men, but every female I've ever seen has left her friends and relatives to upgrade her \"Class\" and \"Standards\" which derived in the first place because of some Rich Guy . Men are such simple minded humans and don't always \"Choose\" friends based on discrimination. Females are the exact opposite. The Guy above seriously needs to tell her to FUCK Off!! The class she's talking about changing in him won't even matter when she'll monkey branch on some other dude. It's his money, time and standard and he can't even have conversations with real interesting people other than the shallow WHORES? That's why MGTOW forever guys.\nI found a girl with an EXTREME scarcity mindset. Is this a good or bad thing?Shes very traditional in her values. Like shes 22 and she will do ANYTHING for me, partly, because shes afraid shell never meet someone else as good as me. Is this a good or bad thing? Edit: Didnt expect the comments. Heres some feedback to clear up the situation. Im mostly asking for perspectives, not advice. 1) at first I didnt even know that the fuck a unicorn was... I had to look it up. No I dont think shes that and I dont think shes perfect. its a stretch for you to assume I did. 2) Weve been fucking for almost a year, no real intentions on LTR or marriage (some guy mentioned me pushing for marriage?). Thats a dumbass assumption and I dont know why you guys think Im trying to LTR her. 3) Yes she is BPD confirmed. For those of you who are scared shitless of BPD women, Ive maximized my benefits from out relationship. You guys just need to know how to control BPD women and dont be so fucking emotionally manipulated 4)\n>I love beating women. I like to hear them scream while I leave them to die in my basement Wow OP, just wow.\nIt's mindblowing that everyone gets more offended when you tell some fat chick to start exercising and stop eating junk food.\nSolution: team up with a Stacy and make her pose with your art then auction it.\nOne thing that helps understanding women- they are always *always* concerned with themselves. Their husband, their parents, even their children always come second to their own interests. Even when it seems they are doing something charitable, it is always for what they get back. I used to work with charities and women loved filling the roles as long as 1) the job was easy and especially 2) they get acknowledged for the job. They will never work anonymously. Ever. That is just how they are wired.\nThe sad truth is that a man is only valued by his actions, whereas a woman is valued by her looks/body, something that is inherent to her.\nyup yup! It's diffucult to unlearn beauty ideals, especially when society reminds you every day that you're ugly. but I love faking confidence. And I notice musty men and Stacys alike fuming when I do Stacy's think \"stay in your place, only I should feel good about myself and enjoy privileges. uglies need to stay at the bottom of the hierarchy and suffer the most from sexism/lookism.\" Men just can't deal with the fact that their lack of attraction to you doesn't make you stay quiet and actually demand respect\nFeminists are the cause of this discrimination in the first place.\nHit her the fuck back, ya pussy\n>Illimitable Men << 3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok. >> The other OK option is if you are the Hiphopopotamus: *My rhymes are so potent that in this small segment* *I made all of the ladies in the area pregnant* *Yeah, sometimes my lyrics are sexist* *But you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this*\nI'm just here to make fun of the mentally unstable and aging party whores.\nSounds like bullshit. Women are programmed to know they can get more. Thats why once you start hitting on a 4-5 she turns into the biggest slut because you made her realize someone wants to fuck her so others will want to as well. Shes is playing you for a sucker\nplease stop valuing the opinion of men you see onlinethis is not a typical \"feel good\" post. this is a reminder. **TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.** if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value. men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that. but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better. I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women. these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s. so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked. also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks. so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.\nI would say you have three possible options. Rookie, intermediate, and advanced. Which option you choose is strictly up to your level of confidence. Rookie: pick her up from work and when you see the guy, just give him a stare. Say nothing. Give him a handshake and crush his hand during the handshake. Say \"is this the fat faggot you were telling me about?\" This path is a little insecure but if fatty is a pussy he will fuck off Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat. If she is jealous of other girls than she will be nervous and trying to please you. What do you think?\nThis is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.\nWeight only matters if you have a pretty bone structure. If youre truly ugly, being skinny/fit only makes you fuckable and not girlfriend material (lookup r/ butterface). Besides, there are places in the world where being thin is not that exalted. Ive been bullied my entire life for being too skinny, here in Brazil, man generally gravitates towards curvy woman.\nProblem is women have most men's favorite treat, pussy. I moved to Latin America and it's easily available so I'm not controlled by it as much as a lonely man in a house in the suburbs of America. I'm not marrying these hoes, just pumping them. I rent once a week,\nLegit I love the bitch he adds at the end it most likely frustrates her further which makes me happy prick gets what she fucking deserves\nThe worldwide hive mind is spot fucking on. Women can't ever be happy at the top of their local social hierarchy anymore, now they hear stories of other middle aged women like MacKenzie Bezos and Janet Jackson on down to Becky down the block divorce raping their hubbies around the world, stealing all the cash, and riding off into the sunset on Tyrone's dick to go shopping forever. The divorce industry keeps profiting and families keep disintegrating by selling these bored housewives a false hope of winning the divorce lottery, all it costs them is everything they built and to hell with the collateral damage. Imagine how many families could be saved if the global hivemind competition was curtailed?\nThis is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.\nWow. That girl is real ugly. Very inappropriate\nOMG Some are so distasteful that I don't even want to genderswap them ... I don't even want to say this as exopsing satire ... yikes...\nMods PLEASE. BAN STACIES/BECKIES/NORMIES FROM MAKING THREADS\nReally bizarre sub. I some times peruse it because some of the more sane posts sometimes have helpful insights into the female experience. On one hand they fucking hate men. It is straight-up sexism that would not stand if the genders were reversed. On the other hand 99% of them seem to not get the irony that they consider themselves a catch, yet they mostly shitpost about getting as much dick in themselves as possible. On the front page right now there is a post ranting about how the OP is taking dick from \"three different low value males\" and how that empowers her while waiting for a \"high value male\". I'm no expert but the sort of guy that they consider the gold standard is either going to be married or smart enough not to pay attention to the kind of people who post on that sub. &#x200B; Like, the mental gymnastics in that sub would win gold at the olympics.\nIs Shelia Szas a nympho??\nSee this? See this shit? I hate this how this is portrayed by women, trying act smarter than men. Sickening. I used to read great comics and all of them had great plot and story. And almost none of them involved women. I would need to find old comic books that doesnt involved the vast amount of stupidity of women.\nWomen hate men who know what they are like, because they know how evil they are themselves, thats why they hate on each other. Stick to your thoughts, dont let em guilt you out of your thoughts.\nFuck that piece of shit bitch\nBreakups are fun, you get to move onto new pussy.\n\"Childish\" to women is a man doing too many things that don't directly benefit a woman. If he isn't serving a woman or piling up resources a woman can land on when she's bucked off the cc, he's being childish. Peter Pan. It's especially objectionable to them if he's doing it with other guys, thereby preventing them from doing something that serves women. When a man is doing something he detests that serves the interests of a woman (and her children), that's when he's being least childish in their eyes. That's when he's a good man. That's when he's a 'real man'. Self-sacrifice in order to give her what she wants but doesn't need and shouldn't accept. But they still won't fuck him much. They prefer fuckbois to 'real men'.\nExposing the toxic side of r/FemaleDatingStrategyHey guys, I recently set up a sub owned by u/Rahvenar called r/M4leDatingStrategy. We want to help use this sub to expose the toxic, sexist, and extremely insecure female incels on the sub. To do so all you have to do is go on r/FemaleDatingStrategy and genderswap all the crazy shit the women there post. Keep in mind I'm a female too and I had enough of these bitches giving us other women a bad rep. Thanks in advance!\nLove this kind of shit. All of the fantasies women love to portray about themselves, really speak about their real life inadequacies. Like captain marvel being the strongest avenger. She's only portrayed that way because in reality, women are weaker than men. Or that black female wakanda scientist in infinity war who was portrayed to be smarter than both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner combined. It was portrayed that way because in reality, men are usually more intelligent than women. One reason we know that women are weak and stupid is because fantasy and comic books portray the opposite.\nTBH its nice playing blue pill with these women sometimes. She even paid for my meal and a train ticket.\nThis is bullshit and horseshit. Both this bitch and ''judge'' need to be shot and killed.\nI pity the kid who literally can't get away from the fact that his mom is a thot. Even if your family moves to another state your classmates might already recognize her the day you move in.\n1. Who cares about this worthless bitch. Consign her to the trash and shes easily replaceable. 2. Sorry to hear about your dad. Yes, you have to get on with it as when one of us falls, another man must pick up his burden. But there will be real pain and grief, and youll have to find a way to deal with that. Take as long as you need, and focus on rebuilding your life and supporting your family emotionally. About the girl: good riddance.\nIMO, it's the lack of fathers. We live in an increasingly male disposable world. There's a very large swath of women that are very vocal about the optionality of fathers. Combine this with the lack of male role models in school (outside of an occasional teacher/coach), and we begin to see how they don't value men.\nChonk bitch\nFacetime? Are you kidding me?I left this sub for some time cause of seeing excessive amounts of useless advice. I came back recently to see if people are actually still hooking up through dating apps / how they are doing so, but I keep seeing posts on \"How to do a Facetime call?\" or \"How to talk to a girl over text?\" or \"Why aren't girls answering my texts?\" Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how much of a waste of time that is? Do you know you're being used? Girls thrive on attention and you're giving them that, especially at a time like this. Seriously, stop it. I see some people claiming they've already made \"5-6 dates possible for after the quarantine.\" Yeah, right cause the first person a girl wants to see after a quarantine is a random fucking stranger they \"met\" on a dating app, Jesus Christ. There's no guarantee you'll meet a girl after the quarantine is over and the quarantine isn't gonna be over anytime soon. You're being delusional and naive. There's no treatment for COVID-19 and there won't be a vaccine for another 12-18 months and yet we're acting like the situation right now is a temporary one, it's not. Get used to it. Either you're making actual moves and meeting people (obviously not in a crowded area), and accept youre taking a risk, or you're not. If you choose not to, then enjoy texting and Facetiming for the next few months-year and watch it take you nowhere. Wake up. Please. Edit: Don't be in denial. Normal life won't resume anytime soon.

First of all I want to say that I never was an outright member of both movement. I agreed with some concepts and while I never fully drank the koolaid, it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology, I can finally say that I got it all out of my system. I write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that I've dealt with. # The beginning It all started when I was about 17/18-ish. During this time I used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there I would sometime read about people being screwed over, relationship wise. At the time I just thought \"shit happens\", but those posts would come again every now and then. My downfall really started on quora and reddit. A big difference between 9gag and these 2 Websites was that the posts didn't have character limits. Quora questions like \"how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you\" and subreddits like r/Relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people (usually men) would be cheated on in the worst way possible. I remember how I would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious. My current situation was as follows: Overweight, virgin, no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low. Just to make you understand how bad it was, I loathed and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and I almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone. # The redpill and mgtow This is when I started to discover the redpill. I watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits. In the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened. They said that Women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it, and everywhere I looked, I would just find more stories that would confirm what I've read and heard from this redpill people. Even though I was deep in the red pill, I still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group. You see, while I believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff, I still couldn't buy the \"all women are like that\" mentality, both from a logical but also an emotional point. i.e. the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men, but I never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators (as far as i'm concerned). I also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them I would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say. She would often spend money on him, she took interest in what he did, etc. If my sister was like that then it wouldn't have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed. To be completely honest I wasn't angry at women, I was scared of them. I was scared that I could be cheated on, that if I got married, they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and I would have raised a child that was not mine. To give you an example of how deep my paranoia went, I often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house, trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner's back just to be sure that I wouldn't not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over. # How I got out Well, to be completely honest it was a multitude of things. First thing first, I deleted reddit and quora. This places were tainted to me and even nowadays I get somewhat nervous if I enter these websites. The next step was actually going my on way. Instead of listening to bitter and resentful people, I slowly began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own. I started to hit the gym (lost 21 kg / 46 pounds) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt. More importantly, I started to be critical of my own beliefs. If I didn't have a sound logic to it, it had to go. Now I'm 20 and I'm far more calm and retrospective person. I'm still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend, but that's just what it is. I learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services. On Monday I will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest, I'm already shitting my pants, but at least now I know that I have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me. cheers. EDIT: I called. It went good. Nothing official because of the current situation, but I'm confident I will get the place.

All identity groups are hypocritical. It's only a problem when the identity hypocrisy crap is weaponized and reified as a Politics instead of a sociological phenomenon. This is the whole problem with all forms of IP. They all politicize and weaponize the irrational BS of the identity group and create politics, rules, and even laws based on the egotistical lies of the ethnic group. IP is politics based on pure lies. This is why it is bad in all forms. The female hypocritical BS noted by OP is just women's politics or feminism and shows why feminism along with all other IP's is so toxic, dishonest, and dangerous. People can never be honest about themselves due to the ego roadblock. The exact same problem exists in all IPs, which are nothing more than conglomerations of the collective egos of groups that share an idhentity.

I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity. I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth. I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago. Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men. I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily. Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted. A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time. I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned: \\- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness. \\- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity. \\- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with. \\- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles. \\- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood. \\- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood. \\- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women. \\- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc. \\- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities. \\- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc. \\- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice. \\- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play. \\- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina. \\- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us. \\- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible.\ntread lightly, watch her actions not her words.\nI found Sarah Thereses YouTube channel after a whole bunch of feminists were upset about her being pro-life and loving her husband.https://www.youtube.com/user/SarahHeartsSparkle Its awesome, very self improvement focused and life style orientated.
