"Do you have the skin of a 80 year old grandma? Worry no more, just drink water!"
"This is taking a grain of truth and extrapolating to insanity. Stay hydrated, it's healthy, you'll look and feel better. It will not reverse the aging process though."
Honestly my favorite thing about this is that they feel the need to cite beauty professionals in order to prove that dehydration is caused by not drinking enough water.
Source? Doesnt sound right to me idk
"It's a question of the sales pitch involved. Obviously, the people from Big Virgin had a better deal."
Some places have poor water quality. Virgin blood may have been less expensive than imported water.
So if I drink enough water I turn into a baby?

Isn't this the plot of Cocoon?
No idea. I watched the movie 10 years or so ago with my dad and all I can remember are the doctors being shocked that the lady was pregnant
In the movie there is this group of elderly that discover that they feel suspiciously rejuvenated by going for a bath in a special swimming pool. I was just being silly with the water/de-aging association.
One of my friends looks like he's frikkin dead. Been trying for years to pour water down his throat and get him to wash his face. Recently won the face washing battle and he looks 5 years younger.
What kinda Tom Brady nonsense is this

"Given that he wants to be associated to one of the sickest of the serial killers out there by his avatar, I doubt it's his looks that turn women off."
My two favorite things about this post are how he unnecessarily details his future niece's ethnic makeup and how he shows his work at the end.
I feel sad for him. He's 22 and already giving up on love and life. I hope that someone can talk to him and get him some help.

Cancer patients have to fight like hell to get a wig for heavens sake. Cant see a barn? You get glasses or contacts because lasik and lasers are cosmetic. If there is any accommodation to get around a problem, you dont qualify for free. Missing blinking limbs? You get a prosthetic sometimes.

God is the reason your personality sucks. I mean
Personally I'd say God made the right call sticking you where you deserve to be.
You know most of these people are mentally ill guys hanging in the wrong crowd. Most of them don't know any better and are only this stubborn because it's the only kind of positive afferment they get from each other. None of them deserve hate or to be made fun of. They just need a bit of pushy help.
"I'm mentally ill too and spent almost my entire teenage years with the same douchebag view on women, I'm the nice guy women should like so I deserve them, blah, blah, blah. We all make choices and I grew out of it. I don't sympathize with them."
"Hahaha... If this is seriously you reaction to people having rights, being sad that you don't have the ability to abuse and exploit them, well then fuck you. Honestly, get bent you ignorant troglodyte. You deserve every ounce and every moment of suffering you're inflictig on yourself for having such a vile mindset, and I'm laughing at you all the way."
"Aren't you super high IQ? Use that big brain, build you a time machine, and leave the rest of us in peace."
"Plot twist he actually does, but then he gets scarlet fever the moment he steps out of the machine."
"I'm personally an atheist, but doesn't God do weird stuff as a way of ""testing"" his believers? See this as a test of faith, dood! Trust that God has a plan or whatever the religious say to cheer each other up."
I would not say that by women getting rights is a test by God. Id say its basic human right.
"While I do personally agree with you, that doesnt mean that it cant also be a test of his character. One that he is failing miserably! Also, depending on which God one considers... women getting rights is kind of against some interpretations of his word."
I'm a Christian and you are actually rather spot on. Our teachings also say that sufferring could also be because God wants to teach you something and become a better person. Too bad these Incels are just blaming their problems on other people instead of taking time to find a solution and to re-examine their way of life.
"I'm sorry, does women having rights mean that us dudes are oppressed somehow?"
"Yes. Rights are like pie. If you have some, that means I get less. /s"
oh noes! oh woe is me! why was i born on a time where the other half of humanity have rights after fighting so long for them! oh the horror! i weep for humanity!

[Journalism]Nintendo Life extends an olive branch for Pete Davison with a freelancer review for Prison Princess.
Thecontext of the situation is that Pete previously wrote an article protesting Pat'o'Reilly's negative panning of more niche titles. Gun Gun Pixies was the last straw for him and it was likely that Nintendo Life took notice and offered Pete a chance to provide more positive coverage of such titles.
"You mean to tell me that the in-house writers for lots of these websites hate these types of titles and almost universally pan them? I'm more shocked they actually reached out to a freelancer to give this title a fair shake, rather than just double-down on the ""lol nah this is pedo-bait"" narrative."
"The guy who wrote GGP's review wasnt a lonely cismale feminist ally but a dad who while enjoys Japanese games, isnt a hardcore weeb. If he was one of those types I would be less sympathic to O'Reilly's articles. Outside of the review, he is an upstanding father and to him its work so he can go back to his kid and play on the switch together, for Pete, its his passion to give games like a fair shake."
Noisy pixel did a good review of it
> Gun Gun Pixies was the last straw for him But y tho?
He wrote an article expressing his outrage at how Pat wont give his games a fair shake and blocked him on twitter after showing him the article on twitter. I mean I wont fault Pat as he is a dad with a kid still in elementary school with a home life and not some lonely californian living in a flat complaining about the patriarchy but what Pat did to Pete felt unprofessional and Nintendo Life looking to gain back some favor picked him for a less biased review.
I read this review earlier today and actually thought it was very fair and reasonable. This is good to see. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come.

Unequal bathrooms. Smh.
"Easy, go to bathroom on his right and say that you call yourself a woman. Get out and change your identity to man. Problems?"
Modern problems require modern solutions.
"In my university they did something similar, they want to know how it work and in each of the four wings they did something diferent. In one is men-women, one is mix-mix, one is men-mix and the last is mix-women (mine). The problem is that they removed the urinals in the men that became mix and that most girls at the end are the ones that complain. (sorry for my bad english i'm not native speaker)"
WTF? And many pseudo-feminists complain that peeing is sexist because they can't stand up to pee like men can.
"If you ever hear someone say that, just tell them that standing to pee is a bad habit by default for men, it's not some privilege of ours and should be stopped. It's been proven that naturally we're built to pee standing, and it's way healthier for dudes."
Nothing stopping women from peeing standing up. They could they choose not to.
If this is at a university you can always file a title IX complaint.
Institutionalized sexism hurting men.
"Liked the video but cringed when he said ""smh""."
"I *loved* the 'smh'. It literally means ""shake my head"". He was on video and he could have actually *shaken his head*. Instead he used a verbal acronym from the imternet to express the same thing. ""Ess Em Aitch"". That's all kinds of mixed meta and para linguistic data!"
Its like the kids who say lol instead of actually laughing (out loud). My cousin used to do this and it sounded like he was just yelling Loll loll loll!

"DON'T use a bathroom that is labeled as unisex unless you can lock the door and it's a good lock. If a little girl walks in and an adult doesn't like that you are in there, you might end up on a list on trumped up charges of being in the bathroom for the purpose of being a pervert or just indecent exposure for using a urinal (or even a toilet, if the kid crawls under the stall wall/door or peeps over the top). When I need to pee on the road, I park in the lot, cover myself with a blanket, and use a cup then toss it (the urine, not the cup) in the woods. If I have to shit, well, I'm a man. I can hold it until I get home, and I'm smart enough to plan out when I eat for when I have to drive."
"Did that toilet brush just *say* ""SMH?"" No wonder they won't trust us with our own bathroom."
No. Its that they dont trust US.
"Right. Because they associate the poor behavior and stupidity of the guys they ""like"" with ""all men."" Never considering that *their* taste in men may be why they have so many bad experiences with men."
"California ex-DA fabricated that a TV Doctor raped 1000 women with no proof, says new DA "" DA Says Couple Accused of Drugging and Raping Up to 1,000 Women Did No Such ThingEx-DA Made it All Up A California prosecutor is dropping all charges against a doctor and his girlfriend, alleging that his predecessor manufactured allegations that the couple drugged and sexually assaulted up to 1,000 women. The stunning turn of events comes a year and a half after the case against [Grant Robicheaux](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-grant-robicheaux-orange-countys-most-eligible-bachelor-accused-of-drugging-raping-women), an orthopedic surgeon who appeared on the TV show *The Online Dating Rituals of the American Male,* and substitute teacher [Cerissa Riley](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cerissa-riley-arrested-for-rapes-with-dr-grant-robicheaux-was-an-evangelical-missionary) exploded into the headlines. At the time, Orange Countys then-district attorney, Tony Rackauckas, claimed the pair lured women to their Newport Beach home, knocked them unconscious, and raped them. At a press conference in September 2018, he said investigators had seized hundreds of incriminating videos from the couples phones. Asked whether the number could be as a high as a thousand, Rackauckas said, I think so. A few months later, though, Rackauckas was out of office, replaced by current DA Todd Spitzer, who eventually ordered a review of the evidence. He says he was appalled by what he found. **The prior District Attorney and his chief of staff manufactured this case and repeatedly misstated the evidence to lead the public and vulnerable women to believe that these two individuals plied up to 1,000 women with drugs and alcohol in order to sexually assault themand videotape the assaults, Spitzer said in a blistering statement.** As a result of the complete case review I ordered beginning in July, **we now know that there was not a single video or photograph depicting an unconscious or incapacitated woman being sexually assaulted.** Rackauckas has not responded to his former rivals allegations. But Robicheauxs attorney praised the reversal..."" &#x200B; Story continues at [https://www.yahoo.com/news/da-says-couple-accused-drugging-025144677.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/da-says-couple-accused-drugging-025144677.html) &#x200B; So the next time you hear how Bill Cosby must be guilty, just look at all of his accusers, think real hard about it. If a DA could literally find 1000 accusers out of thin air that a new DA has determined to all be fake, every single one, all of a suddenly it becomes much more plausible that a congo line of fake accusers be rolled out against any man. Come on, if there was really all that much rape out there, do you think the DAs would have to be inventing ones that don't exist?"
See given the chance a man will rape thousands...oh wait.
"how do you even rape 1000 women. i mean thats a lot of people. 100, maybe, in the span of a decade. 1000? what."
The same thing happened to former OKC police officer Daniel Holtzclaw but he was convicted and sentenced to 263 years in prison based on nothing more than the testimony of prostitutes and drug addicts.
"Holtzclaw was a rapist. His dna was found in places it shouldn't have been if he was honest, and he made highly incriminating statements and used the police database to conduct illegal searches."
Didnt Cosby admit to drugging women though?
"No, he admitted to doing drugs with them. Ie, if you smoke weed with someone you do drugs with them. If you put weed oil into their drink and they don't know, you are drugging them. Media purposely misreported this."
">Media purposely misreported this. I agree. IMO, they were deliberately vague with the term ""giving"". It could mean,"" offered something freely which someone else accepted"" or ""secretly planted"". It seemed like they wanted viewers to accept the latter, while still being to claim the former."
"Not so fast. Read the accounts from the women. The good doctor clearly has connections which got the charges dropped. Look, his bail was set at only $100,000 for multiple rape charges. And who else gets charged with cocaine and MDMA posession with intent to sell, as well as weapons charges, and then they just drop the charges, even though cocaine, MDMA, and weapons were confiscated from his home? What the hell? Oh wait...the good doctor played little league ball with the judge's kid? He lives around the corner from the judge in Newport? Their families have been friends for years? Well... just promise you won't do it again and tell your pops I said hello."
"Unless you are black you don't go to jail for having a little bit of drugs or guns in America, nice try."
"What about all these folks who knew him coming out and calling him a known rapist? Are they lying? It was reported that they have video evidence of all the incidents on his phone, so was that faked as well? Its kind of sick that people who knew him could have defamed him with no evidence of wrongdoing. The kind of people to do that dont care about him, so what relational merit do they actually have? Personally, I dont buy it because swingers are careful about how they swing and its not fun to swing with an unconscious person."
LMFAO!!! Well it looks like their attempts to censor freedom of speech is backfiring!!! I never heard of this subreddit until the quarantine! and here I am!!!! LMAO!!!! VICTORY!!!!!!!!
This quarantine is probably for the best as it gives us more privacy.
"On the other hand, the official label seems to be giving the blue-pill trolls more justification to take cheap shots at us. Not that I care though - it tells you more about them than us of course."
"I hate when trying to have a conversation about something and all the responses are he hates women, look he posted on MGTOW. Thats an incel MRA hate speech group and then all the comments below are echoing. Would be nice to just have an open conversation about controversial topics where the arguments are dismantled instead of the people involved."
Going your own way as a guy is highly offensive apparently. When a women goes her own way... you go girl! A women doesnt always need a man
"They loving shaming us with insults ""Incels!"" or taunts ""Man up!"" It takes courage to just keep walking, but once you taste the freedom you can't turn back towards the plantation."
Yeah. Like a fish a bicycle. The fish term fits on so many levels.

This happened in 1996. If this was 2020 the judge would let her keep the ticket and still force the ex husband to pay alimony.
Let me guess. She divorced and then cashed the ticket?
"Nah not quite. Won just short of 2 million in '96 (yeah, 1996), didn't tell a soul, pressed for divorce, didn't disclose it as an asset - not even to her own counsel. She was found out when the court was going through everything in '99. Judge gave her winnings to the husband."
"Got it. That was my first guess, but everybody knows that undisclosed funds are awarded to other spouse. Sounds like she knew and still gambled. Even cashing in later is not bullet proof. They query a lottery, cross check dates and you are doomed."
Old story. She filed an appeal though - and lost. [http://www.metnews.com/articles/ross0625.htm?hc\_location=ufi](http://www.metnews.com/articles/ross0625.htm?hc_location=ufi)

"it took them this long to quarantine. once upon a time we were simply dismissed and ridiculed. Now its censorship. This is progress. We give them something to look at. Something for young men to think about. An inevitability, a natural progression. What happens next? Doesnt matter We are already here, wether it be on reddit or elsewhere. neither a group or an individual. An idea that never truly goes away."
And they couldn't justify the quarantine with facts. They had to use a straw man.
What was the strawman? I never got to see the reasoning
"The police found some asshole who joined here and who had been searching for violXXt topics that had to do with terrXXism. So reddit takes this idiot as representing this sub and uses that as an excuse to quarantine it. They didn't point to any posts that dude made, just his Internet searches, as if the mods here can do anything at all to control what someone types into google. It's bullshit. It could even have been an FDS idiot who clicked ""join"" and then did those searches."
"MGTOW is in your head. That this sub exists or not, it doesn't matter. As long as my eyes became wide open, thats all that matter to me."

I was mgtow before I'd even heard the term. It is nice to have a place to discuss these ideas though.
"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" We used to be in the first two steps. The quarantine means they are officially starting the fight. We WILL inevitably win, no matter how ugly it gets. Even if every single MGTOW is hunted to extinction, we embody the truth, and the truth always wins in the end."
"Hunted to extinction.. That's rich. Most MGTOW are self sufficient, and minimalist. Go 100 yards off the beaten path, and you are completely safe most of your pursuers will be out of breath in the first 50 ft, lose interest, or otherwise give up because ""roughing it is hard."""
"I hadn't thought about that, but, my god, you're so right."
"It was meant to be hyperbolic and represent a ""worst case scenario"" to prove a point Obviously, MGTOWs will NOT be hunted to extinction, but even if by some crazy magic pixie dust we were all killed, what MGTOW preaches will still win in the end."
"""You can kill a man but you cannot kill an idea."""
"Im almost positive reddit and vice were working together to get MGTOW labeled as white supremacists. I wouldn't be surprised. They'll do anything to silence men. I've seen posts about male suicide getting taken down, they literally want men gone. They dont give a fuck about us anymore."
"These people are straight stupid. White supremacy? Ive spoken to Black, Asian and Indian men through this platform, all of them are equally burned by women. We are here to lift each other up and find new directions Thats what scares them"
"Labeling everything they don't like at this way, will only result in indifference, so it won't work anymore."
"""*First they ignore you*, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win"
So is there no way to get out of quarantine? Also can anyone post the statement given to quarantine this sub.
Yeah was surprised it took them this long to do it too.
First they ignore you Then they mock you Then they fight you And then you win
This is true.
Sadly never goes away

"Drip, drip. Another story gets out, another few converted. Slowly but surely, men will begin to go their own way."

It's fucked up that A) The world has come to this. B) That many guys have to be told to install cameras because of how naive they are. C) The best gift to a young man going to college is a security camera for his dorm room with a stack of high capacity hard drives.

"Thats awful man. Im so sorry to hear that. You deserve much better. The system is so messed up..... Had a friend of mine who dated this one girl. She once, without asking, unzipped his pants and blew him. He asked her to stop; she kept going. He breaks up with her sometime later and she gets upset and falsely accuses him of rape. (This was while we were in our senior year of high school). Everyone took the girls side and people were making death threats on a regular basis. One of his exswho was notorious for being feminist to the point that the word was almost synonymous with her namealso came forward with a false rape accusation. Even more people got pissed off and took up the MeToo ideology. Police had to escort my friend wherever he went bc he actually got jumped a few times Fortunately, no legal action was taken against him. Eventually it all blew over but several still thought my friend was in the wrong after it since they never listened to the truth. Now, my friend asks for permission to do simple things such as hug, shake hands, high five, help someone up, etcall because hes worried someone will toss him a false accusation if he doesnt hear clear consent for simple interactions.....its really messed up"
Not even jews in concentration camps were psychologically destroyed to this level!
Can you imagine how much the wahmen value those laws? No wonder they hate us.
The same people who quarantined this sub would just call him an incel and tell him to man up.
"Had a girlfriend that tried this- she hit me and put her arms down, expecting me to punch her. I just laughed and told her to get out. She told me she would tell everyone I hit her and I said she should go ahead. There were no bruises and no marks to back up her story. Everyone would know it's bullshit because if I hit her there would be a lot of evidence. They also know I'm a good guy and she's unstable. Oh yeah, she was also a feminist and bragged about her checks on the oppression list (many of which were made up). She is middle aged and lives alone with her cat now."
"my ex got me with a domestic, and she didnt had a single mark on her, it doesnt matter unless you get a real lawyer bro, if you have a public defender your going to take a plea deal"
"I know, I was worried about that but she wasn't too smart and didn't think of it. Probably a good thing. Eventually she would have caved and fucked herself even harder"

"She dead. Johnny Depp is a man of great talent, has a huge resume of awesome films and has been adored by Hollywood for decades. He also oozes coolness beyond and human being. I've seen her in Aquaman and that's about it and that film was totally shit no matter what spoofed IMDB rating it has. She's gonna be outcast and rightfully so"
"No she isnt unfortunately. Worst case scenario shell just announce shes getting counseling and because shes an attractive female, shell get that pass. Unless pictures surface of him with a battered, puffy face that would make even women recoil, guys simply dont get sympathy in western culture in domestic abuse cases."
Theres a photo circulating with his severed finger.
"To be fair, remember those photos of Rhianna. Chris Browns still doing ok these days."
i have a question why did she do it
Because why not. She got popular thanks to the #MeToo movement and she is just one of the many. Now she is one of the few. For now. Let's see if she gets media crucified.
"Too bad for her because she is soooooo hot though, specially look so hot on Aquaman. Sucks that she is a terrible person, not because of what occurred in their relationship (I am in the camp both are shitty people IRL), but that she got on that #MeToo and tried to put everything on Depp."

"[Ethics] Independent: ""Jordan Peterson suffers year of 'absolute hell' and needs emergency treatment for drug addiction that forced him to withdraw from public life, daughter says"" (Misconstrues Jordan Peterson's situation, while using the opportunity to slander him)"
"While the title may seem to make sense, there's a reason [why Jordan Peterson's daughter is...less than pleased](https://twitter.com/MikhailaAleksis/status/1226408508670779392). >The Canadian psychologist, who has attracted a substantial [far-right](https://web.archive.org/web/20200209135414/http://independent.co.uk/topic/far-right) following, has withdrawn from the public eye due to his spiralling addiction to benzodiazepines. > >Withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines, which include Valium,Xanex and others, include acute anxiety, panic attacks, vomiting, insomnia, muscle twitches, headaches, paranoia, memory loss and in the most extreme instances seizures which can cause death. > >Petersons daughter,MikhailaPeterson, said his physical dependence on benzodiazepine tranquilisers first became clear to his family last April when his wife of 30 years, Tammy, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. > >The controversial academic had been consuming the drug for years to alleviate persistent anxiety in the wake of a severe autoimmune reaction to food. Then the article doubles down on the smearing: >Peterson was fairly unknown outside of his discipline until 2016, when he declared he would not use gender-neutral pronouns for transgender students at the University of Toronto. > >The ""alt-right"" figurehead, who has written a number of popular books, has billed himself as a foe of so-called political correctness. Attracting widespread accusations oftransphobia,he has criticised political correctness linked to transgender rights, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism. > >He once urged women to stand up against their crazy, harpy sisters, and has been condemned for failing to reprimanding his supporters when they bombard his critics with vitriolic abuse. As Mikhaila herself puts it: >Theres a reason its called benzodiazepine PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE [@Independent](https://twitter.com/Independent) . Clearly you do not understand this drug in the least."
"This situation has upset me greatly. Not necessarily because it's because JBP (whom I have a lot of respect for), but because the reaction to this news from the social justice crowd has been _sheer glee_. ""I hope he dies a long and painful death"" is a legitimate quote I've seen in response to JBP getting ill. Sentiments expressing that he 'deserves it' and 'is a hypocrite' are widespread. How fucking terrible do you have to be as a person to _actively revel in someone's misery_, especially when that someone has had nearly both himself and his wife die in short order? It really concerns me that people have always been this awful and that social media has just amplified the capability of being a piece of pond scum. I guess this is a major problem of 'woke culture' - the desire of death to your political opponents seems to be an inherently ""progressive"" position nowadays. Which is absolutely sickening."
"You don't have to like Jordan Peterson or fully agree with his views. But the kind of vitriol and hatred being spewed against him from people feigning to be all about love, tolerance and empathy (ironically showing they have *none*) is ESPECIALLY telling."
"> people feigning to be all about love, tolerance and empathy They don't need to feign those things. They redefine them until they have them and we don't."
A few more years and they will be advocating political dissidents need to be put into camps.
We're already there with what Sanders supporters are saying.

"One troubling aspect of this story is the mention of him seeking treatment in Russia, and that ""a number of US hospitals misdiagnosed him."" It's incredibly unlikely that a number of hospitals would misdiagnose him, or that *Russia* of all places has the answer. Something's up."
"According to the transcript from his daughter via *[The Post Millennial](https://web.archive.org/web/20200207234045/https://www.thepostmillennial.com/exclusive-update-on-the-health-of-dr-jordan-b-peterson/)*: >After several failed treatment attempts in North American hospitals, including attempts at tapering and micro-tapering, we had to seek an emergency medical benzodiazepine detox, which we were only able to find in Russia. It was incredibly gruelling and was further complicated by severe pneumonia which weve been told he developed in one of the previous hospitals. >Hes had to spend four weeks in the ICU in terrible shape, but, with the help of some extremely competent and courageous doctors, he survived. The decision to bring him to Russia was made in extreme desperation when we couldnt find any better option. The uncertainty around his recovery has been one of the most difficult and scary experiences weve ever had."
"Whoa, had no clue all this was going on with him. Sounds awful."
"There were some hints before, though it's only recently that the full extent (or at least as far as we know) came out."
"I was disappointed with one of Peterson's appearances on Joe Rogan's podcast where he revealed that his daughter's lifelong struggle with an unspecified autoimmune disease had been put into remission by adhering to an all-meat diet. And that he personally was currently trying it for weeks and had noticed similar health benefits. The trust in dietary pseudoscience at the time seemed very out of place with someone who is so well versed in history, well read and readily quotes primary literature research from his own field. Then looking at his daughter's Twitter account yesterday, I've noticed she's become a Gwyneth Paltrow-style huckster for this self-proclaimed ""Lion Diet"" of beef, salt and water. It's unfortunate that even analytical minds can be susceptible to snake oil."
Experts are only experts in their field. It's why it's dangerous to blindly trust someone when they go outside their area of expertise
"It was in fact sobering, as I do enjoy and respect Peterson for the most part. It was just very disappointing when someone so learned and so critical of the false beliefs of others suddenly jumped on the ""miracle cure"" bandwagon, suggesting complex diseases like lupus, Crohn's, MS, rheumatism, etc could potentially be solved by eliminating, well everything from our diets, without a lick of primary literature backing it up."
"From what I could look up, her ""Lion Diet"" seems to make about as much sense as ""Crystal Skull Vodka"", though at least like the vodka, there's still *something* of merit in there. Gwyneth Paltrow's snake oil, on the other hand, is a *whole* 'nother level..."
Typical garbage from a shitrag like the Independent. How long before those useless sacks of trash get sued for libel and defamation?
"Your guess, alas, is as good as mine."
Never.
"Can you describe more of this bullying? Paranoia can kick in pretty well. You feel like everyone is looking at you and judging, making fun or being disgusted. But in reality it could be not that vivid. People in life usually don't look at others in disgust. Adult world isn't like that. Why would anyone do that. Unless they are just cruel kids."
"I agree. I think bullying in adulthood usually tends to be in the form of social evasion, alienation, sabotaging and lack of cooperation or support. Adults can't afford nor care to be as direct and immature as children because they're fully developed and therefore unpolite behavior is seen more as a toxic personality trait instead of 'kids being kids'."
Ignorance is bliss
Nah. I would say that people and relations between are my hobby. I'm pretty receptive. It's not usual behaviour you see at work or in public places like metro.
Massive fucking cope holy shit. People look at others in disgust all the time.
"I have never once seen full grown adults gawk at a person because they're ""ugly."" You guys are so full of shit it's not even funny. Or maybe this is just satire? Paranoia is a real thing. Try and realize that"
I went outside to buy cigs just a few minutes ago and a group of girls walking past laughed at my face. This happens on a weekly basis. It's a dog eat dog world. People love shitting on anyone worse than them. It provides an ego boost.
Dude shut up lmao
what makes you so certain that they were laughing at your face? thats a pretty big assumption to make..
"> I shower twice a day Theres your problem. Not enough showers. Inkwells must shower at minimum 3 times a day, sometimes even 4 depending on how good your personality had been the day before."
Why are you giving him this bad advice? At least 400 showers daily are recommended. Anything less and you have nothing to complain about sweaty.
\>Getting out of the shower There's your problem. Just live your whole life under the shower bro.
"You should report this to the university, this behaviour surely violates any code of conduct and would have to be dealt with."
Say hello to modern adults. Degenerate manchildren. All of them. We're at the point where people will defend a grown man crying over star wars. Honestly it does not surprise me that this is real. You must have one hell of a pampered and unchallenging life to be able to act so much like a child. I honestly wish I could have this child like mentality so I could gain some confidence. Looks like many of us just grew up too fast.
PM me your pic
Is this for real? If so its appalling behaviour and completely fucking unnaceptable.
"Man how can you possibly be that ugly? What aspect of you do you think is causing this? I seriously think it's in your head, to some extent."
Yet another thread that IT won't touch. Are you Indian?
'Women are the real victim of war when they have to do the jobs normally performed by men.. because all the men are dead'
Women are victims = having to do work
How can anyone say this with a straight face is beyond me.
Even when they're dead it's still a man's fault.
Boo-fucking-hoo.
But did they die tho?
These people are absolutely insane
"Well they could have fought along side or just do the fighting for the guys, we don't mind being the victim of wars. Go go girls !"
"Not to mention, they'd be at least 10 times more effective than men according to movies and video games. Grrrrrrlll powa!"
"Well, she Is a gender specialist..."
She and Hilary Clinton would get along just fine
"""Gah! Those pesky men and their privilege! I can't BELIEVE that I have to take out the trash on my own now - all because my selfish husband took it upon himself to take up arms to defend his family and is now rotting in a shallow grave, riddled with bullet holes. I mean, the sheer CHEEK of him dying in battle and leaving me to do chores like this!"""
Unironically their thought process probably
"In order words: before the war, men were the victims for having to do this work ? And now they are privileged for the opportunity to leave their awful job and go die somewhere instead. Bunch of lucky bastards."
Clown world. Absolute clown world.
Such a burden not being dead or dismembered the poor things.
Mental gymnastics: 100
He is unable to be a utility for me. Man bad.

"Two more days until ""handout day"" arrives and it is sad how men are so gullable to go along with this wallet empting tradition."
"I havent noticed anything different, but I try to blend in to the background when Im out of the house anyway."
Sad but true.
You guys have been getting messages and looks? I haven't had that in years and happy for it. Stay strong guys.
"Yup, got two from the past asking me to send flowers. Uhm... No thanks?"
"WTF. For real? In all honesty though, never understood the concept of giving flowers. One kills a living thing to portray their love for someone? WTF is that shit."
"Right? Plus it's a bad investment, flowers die quickly. It's symbolic for love, and how quickly it dies. Then it gets thrown out loool"
"right. some think bjs are a christmas / bday gift. if you are in a relationship where that's a gift, take your L. Especially when other dudes are getting that same gift."

"Summary: _Andre & Tom discuss the film ""Birds of Prey"" and the media ""blame game"" beginning before the weekend has ended about the failure of the film and why, joining them is distinguished guest, YouTube Lauren Chen._"
"They didn't go with ""blame the men"" this time because that would still be a backhanded admission that men refused to see the movie after its marketing shat on us. After briefly testing out ""superhero fatigue"" and ""coronavirus panic"", they seem to have settled the narrative on ""it's the R rating's fault"", despite the fact that the highest grossing R rated movies are Joker and Deadpool, and modern Harley is pretty much the lovechild of Joker and Deadpool."
"The only ""superhero fatigue"" I would consider is that people see Margot Robbie as Harley again and they think: Suicide Squad 2. Nobody fucking wants to go see Suicide Squad again."
I do!
"I saw ""Assault on Arkham"" so I didn't need to see Suicide Squad."
# metoo While for from perfect I quite enjoyed the movie.
*Admiral Gender Studies glares at you*
>*Admiral Gender Studies glares at you* Why is an actress glaring at me? Is she one of the three Birds of Prey actresses that no one knows the names of or cares about?
"Maybe it's because the trailers made it look like basically a female supervillian version of ""Batman And Robin""? Or perhaps the female supervillain version of ""Batman and Robin: The Musical?"""
"I've heard the unflattering comparisons to Batman & Robin (the film of course) come up a few times now from some pretty disparate sources. What genius looks at the entirety of Bat Family, even superhero in general film canon, sees Schumacher's '97 film in that huge pile and says ""yeah this is the ticket!"""
"The visuals in the marketing do look bad. And the action showed in the marketing also looks bad. And Harley comes off obnoxious. There's no Joker (who is perhaps DC movie's biggest draw) and if you are focusing on Harley, there's other things that can be explored other than, ""She's woke!"" Harley is a much stronger character as a villain than a anti-hero as well."
The movie nobody asked for that got very little marketing and wasnt aimed at anyone who actually goes to movies or enjoys DC films failed? Say it ain't so.
"> The movie nobody asked for that got very little marketing Honestly, I didn't even know it had been made until I saw the first trailer for it around New Years. I saw no hype for it whatsoever, not even when *Joker* was at its peak. Its like the makers almost forgot that they had another DCEU film coming out."
"Joker was not a DCEU film, it was seperate from the DCEU That is DC's and WB biggest folly is the fact there is no single Cinematic universe they are building like Marvel did The TV shows are separate from Films, and not even all the films are set in the same universe And up until recently not even all the shows were set in the same universe, they did kind of haphazardly attempt to pull them all together though finally,"
Actually a lot of us comic book readers wanted a Birds of Prey movie and were happy when it was announced. However when this movie was announced there was also Gotham City Sirens and Batgirl movie announced too. The theory is when Sirens and Batgirl were cancelled or put on hold Harley was added to Birds of Prey due to Margot Robbies contract.

i stopped reading once he said his main girl wasnt into other girls.... only way a 3sum really works is if both girls are bi.

"Good points in here but I gotta cringe at >I could tell she was getting turned on by seeing me expertly seduce another attractive girl in front of her. The whole thing is about sex, does the writing have to be masturbatory? Hard to take the points seriously when he sounds like a comical macho version of himself."
Seems like a common theme with people posting here.
"I wouldn't say I'm versed enough to make that call, but I have seen it before. I, personally, have a harder time taking these seriously when they're written like this. It's like the focus shifts from helping others and sharing knowledge and experience, to some sort of ego gratifying boast. Really pulls me out of it."
"Ironically, forming a caricature of himself shows insecurity, which to me is the opposite of true masculinity. Have all the threesomes you want, but writing, boasting and acting in that way is inauthentic and childish."
"Since no-one uplifts us, let's uplift ourselvesI uplift myself through self care. I take special care of my hair and I try different styling techniques, I try not to skip my skin care and I apply a mask on my face once a week (I feel very feminine , like those images of women with masks on their faces and slices of cucumber on their eyes lol), I do my nails twice a month, I remind myself to wear accessories because I feel so much better when I wear a pair of earrings or a necklace. My favourite part of my own interpretation of self care and uplifting myself, are my me-parties. Usually on Friday night, since I don't go out, I have the best time with myself! I throw my own fashion show, where I try on clothes I don't usually wear or I experiment with my clothes to create different styles, I do my make up, I dance by myself and I sometimes do karaoke. I also wear my high heels which I rarely wear outside! It's not like I am able to forget how undesirable and lonely I am, but at least I am able to have fun by myself!"
youre such a wholesome person
"That's cute. :3 I try to uplift myself by cooking home-made dinners or treating myself to pancakes outside. I too wear peeling masks every once and then, prolly not often enough."
"Oh yes! I love cooking! I also want to try going out to eat alone! I am not that comfortable in public yet, but I'm getting there!"
my valentine's day present to myself will be getting my eyeliner tattooed :)
I love the idea of gifting yourself on Valentine's!
lol i was planning on getting it done anyway :) the booking on the 14 was a lucky coincidence :)
Haha but now you gave me a great idea! I'm buying myself some piece of jewellery or a dress as a Valentine's gift!
go treat yourself! :) now's a great time to buy jewellery cos of all the promotions anyway
in terms of self care i guess i want to go to psychotherapy or get on meds and finally get my mental health under control. i've been like a dead man walking for 8 years now and i either get healthy or die.
I love this post. I love you. Cheers to self-care <3

Well then
thread locked. shocker
It was locked because the mod was tired of reading incel logic... its one thing if it breaks a rule or comments get out of hand but for that is openly admitting they dont actually believe all survivors.
Then why is he/she still functioning as mod? Isn't he tired?
Which apparently means believing women can rape and lie about it.
First rule of false allegation : We don't talk about false allegation !
Shit mod does shit thing while simultaneously shaming men.

"The truth will eventually come out. That is one sensitive situation. I'm glad that she admitted to it, because it would have been close to impossible to prove without professional police investigation as they see and deal with these types of messes on a regular basis. There are patterns that they can pick up on better than we can because they have no emotional investment in the case. Now it's time to process, heal and forgive. You don't need to be incredibly close, but be civil to your sister. Your parents will come around as well. Time will erode the stress. Stay away for a while. I was on the path to something similar, but gave my wife the heads up and asked her to watch for the signs. She did, and noticed the same. I keep my distance, and they meet up at my in-laws now. Nothing has been said openly, but at least there's awareness."
"Yep. Sometimes l, like you said, after judgement has already been made. There is an effect and I can't remember the term, but it has something to do with presenting your version of a story first to the masses even though it's untrue and just continue to hammer it in. Then the truth comes out, and although acknowledged, the masses still flock to the first version. Hope I laid this out correctly."
I guess u/budlejari couldn't stand the truth...
Im not reading all that. Im sorry. Can someone summarize?
"BF confesses to GF that he was raped by her sister while he was heavily drunk, sister claims it was the other way around, family drama happens and blames the BF. GF catches her sister lying and makes her BF press charges."
"I understand the family part, it's really weird for a younger woman to rape an older guy; the boyfriend is quite unfamiliar to them but the sister was with them since they were born. Not pointing fingers though."
"> it's really weird for a younger woman to rape an older guy It's not 8 and 25. They were both old enough to be at the party. Age after that is mostly a liability (being weaker, more fragile health) the higher it gets, not a power upgrade."
That's a horribly fucked up situation. I'm not even involved here and the whole thing makes my blood boil.

"Bernie is a commie jew....no wonder the sheep masses love him. I wonder why the system hates him so much...probably because it'd be too transparent and people , white people, may start to wake up to our genocide if someone who is openly jewish and anti white was elected... Remember, they are ""white"" just like us , goyim"
Hes certainly a self-described commie but only a Jew when its intersectionally convenient for him.
"What makes you say that? I dont know much about Bernie but what cuck traitors like Rush L and Sean good goy Hannity say.. i listen to them on NPR in the car once in a while for the ""israel is our greatest ally"" and ""CivNat"" lolz"
Prostitution but now with a monthly subscription. Also less sex.
"In my case, my oldest friends are from childhood, and the Army. I would say, do what you love to do, and find brothers therein who have been red-pilled by life. In my case, I have married friends, and Red Pill friends. The Red Pill friends have lived the XX experience. Shared activity is how we, as men, bond. Try Meetup. Or a Maker guild. Or start something on your own. Just remember- that feeling of isolation is DELIBERATE. Our society PREFERS you that way. Be as water in the river- flow AROUND the rock."
"People in general are just bad at relationships in general. No one is perfect and every relationship will have friction to work through. That said there are many people that you should figure out arent worth investing in, but plenty people are worth it. Dont give up because of experiences that burnt you, recover, set better boundaries now that youve learned something, get back out there and risk. Friendship is really simple, you just have to be intentional now as an adult where no-one is sitting you in a room with the same 30 people all year; like all things that are worth it, they are simple, but difficult, we are all just so lazy in the west with resources to distance ourselves. Be the initiator, every time Ive reached out to friendships that fell to the wayside because life just happens and derails things, or even if there was hurt, weve always appreciated it and everyone always says something like man why dont we do this more, Im so bad about keeping up with people etc... solo-entertainment is just so easily at our fingertips, put some energy into your life and get out there and engage, plan for some friends, give yourself to them. Also dont fret to much over blue piller friends unless they are an actual danger to yourself. I have some great blue pill friends who are slowly slowly turning red. Be the friend that is there when theyre run over by life for their blind spots, theyll really need a friend then, even better if that friend can give them some red pills. How do you have 40 year long friends? I imagine something like never giving up on that friendship. Its very unlikely you just stumble upon red pillers for friends, much more likely that you can make some, because the truth and better ideas always wins out."
"Thanks for your wisdom. I've always been the outgoing type more so than the rest of my friends so I don't have any problem. Meeting new people really. I'm just a bit pickier now about the caliber of people I try to form bonds with like you said. And fortunately with the blue pill guys had known since childhood. There's a bit more complicated history there. They kind of blew up a really. Good Business Partnership. Because of things at home with their females and financial pressures. So if we ever do patch things up, it's going to need a lot more time than I've given it so far."
"Yup. I've the same. Money? How much. Shelter? Me casa es su casa. A kidney? Sure, I've got a spare.."
Great post friend!
"Mother of god, 500k divorce costs and she received a **USD 1,000 per week** allowance. That is absolutely insane, I can't imagine how I would be able to cope with that. Imagine the wealth, peace and generally fulfillment you would have with all that money in savings and/or investments."

Well said and Tank You ! all of it.
"I should create one of thos vision boards and add her to it haha. I love reading about women who lived successful lives outside the confines of conservatism historically. How many women didn't want to get married back then but had to. She could have easily found a rich, attractive man to settle down with and be a doting housewife but that wasnt her thing. Two men fought a duel over her and she chose neither. She probably got to travel to places people didn't even get to see in pictures at the time. I won't romanticize though. The quote is also quite sad, it reminds me of what Daisy said in the Great Gatsby ""I hope shell be a foolthats the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" On a side note, she was probably seen as a Kardashian or a Miley Cyrus + Taylor Swift combo."
"I think beauty standards have also changed. I know people here always harp on ""objective"" standards of beauty, but even contemporaneously, there are different visions of beauty. Look at some of the types of surgeries popular in East Asia right now, like V-line jaw surgery and cheekbone reduction, compared with the injections people in Western societies are getting to make those same features larger and more prominent. While there may be a certain amount of agreement on who is attractive, the degree of variation across people's preferences is always overlooked here. I know tons of guys who are just into any generic-faced skinny blonde chick, and wouldn't look twice at someone like [Kelly Gale](https://www.google.com/search?q=kelly+gale&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS855US855&sxsrf=ACYBGNTCYzM4Q-l5AURWBfu675t2OUpIHg:1581555307172&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjN8JrSqM3nAhWtHjQIHTE_DsoQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1920&bih=1057) or [Anais Mali](https://www.google.com/search?q=anais+mali&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS855US855&sxsrf=ACYBGNQHFOvVhS6JmQu4gDGULv2r2fhZBw:1581555356653&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidiefpqM3nAhXtGDQIHbukDIcQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1920&bih=1057)."
Tbh its kinda weird to think about how the timeframe which women have been given full equality and that too only in first world countries is equivalent to a blink of an eye when comparing it to the amount of time humans have existed
"Why do they insist in the ""they defend women in an attempt to get laid"" narrative?"
Because thats how they think you get laid
My wife doesn't even know my Reddit handle. She's probably never heard of incels. Still getting laid tonight. Make of that what you will.
That you're a man without kids yet?
"Nope, actually trying to get my youngest to sleep right now."
Awesome screen name and I feel your pain on that one.
"Thank you! He's our challenge. Sweetest kid in the world, but man is he strong willed."
"I normally need to put in two weeks written notice, make sure the tides and planets are in proper alignment and pray to $Deity that one of my kids doesn't wake up. (I'm sure this frustrating stage will pass)"
"Ha! We definitely had struggles, especially after the second. I can't promise it will pass since I don't know you, but it will if you're both open to communicating your wants and needs and receptive to what the other I saying. It took the same ""discussion"" (read: argument) like 8-10 times before we made any progress. It's still tougher than before kids, but it's also arguably as good as it's ever been for us. Long story short: communication."
What if you're a woman defending other women and you're straight?
"Then it's obvious that you're doing it in hopes that the male users of this sub sees it and become attracted to you because you're defending the same women we are defending. Lol, it actually wouldn't surprise me if they said something like that. I'm sure they've got some crazy explanation for it."
"I am married, but the Incels who message me seem to take offense to the fact I am married and in an open marriage. More so I think they're offended that I am a woman. I think being a woman is something they find offensive, although I really can't see why since they at the same time want to have sex...with women."
"They like the concept of a woman. They like to take that concept and reduce it to an object. Women having thoughts and feelings and basically not being cooking, cleaning, blow job giving machines is offensive to them."
Because they can't comprehend people being appalled at their shit and calling them out on it without some ulterior motive.

From a post on r/justneckbeardthings. Guy is triggered by leggings that look like hair
"These guys just *love* telling women what women want, how women behave and what women think."
How else are we supposed to know.
"Wtf are you talking about I had an Italian boyfriend with tons of chest hair and he was hot af. Cant go wrong with a happy trail either or leg hair or forearm hair. Without pubes I feel like like Im cradle robbing. Im not a beard kinda gal but stubble is really nice (believe me, Italian guys will have stubble two hours after shaving)"
"Same! My boyfriend is European and has thick, dark chest hair. Absolutely no complaints from me."
Plenty of women like or at least don't mind hairy men.
There were times where men were worried about their lack of chest hair and the chest hair toupet became subject of jokes. And Sean Connery became a sex symbol because of exactly that. I'll give it to them that it's sort of a vintage preference and that the razor industry is trying to push fully shaven as a male beauty standard. But it's not catching on nearly as well as it did for women. I for one love hair on a man. :)
"i shave my legs most of the time mainly because i have really black thick hair and i don't like the looks of it sometimes i don't shave because im lazy like in winter for example, and it give me an extra layer of insulation lmao"
"Thoughts and prayers to all the innocent, terrified men currently being held at gunpoint until they stop recoiling at their girlfriends' 3-day leg stubble."
"Pfft, 3 day stubble is for wimps. Im talking 3 month growth, Im talking FURRY."
And there are lots of furries.
Luckily for my future bf I can't seam to grow hair on my legs. He will have to deal with a light mustache tough
"""Have you ever met a real life woman before?"" I'm guessing the answer is not ""Yes."" And most women still shave their legs and pits. If you don't like women who choose not to conform to that particular requirement, you can look for one of the many more who do shave."
Their own mom I mean.
"Have seen a few of them talk about their mothers in very disturbing ways, but they're more likely to violently hate their mothers than anything else."
I gotta admit tho itd be a total mindfuck to shave legs and then wear hairy leggings!
I'm pretty hairy and my girlfriend doesn't seem to mind. I'm also almost positive my girl only shaves her legs if she is gonna wear shorts or something and it's winter here....
I normally don't shave because I have extremely sensitive skin. I do shave my armpits because I think it gets gross specially during the summer with all the sweating. I do shave if I'm going to wear a dress or a bathing suit. Luckily I'm not a hairy person (thanks genetics) . I have only met one woman in my life who didn't shave her legs even when wearing dresses or shorts. And what? who preffers a non hairy guy? The only waxed guys I find hot are wrestlers. The rest I have no issue
"All guys know how disgusting they are, as a collectiveI was playing VRchat with my friends when we stumbled upon a younger girl who was talking about ""meeting a guy in real life"". As she spoke more and more people gathered, most of them were guys. Then she said his age was 25, while she was just 13. Unanimously, every single guy in her immediately vicinity started screaming for her to ""not even think about it"" and that he ""did not want to meet up with her"". They all knew he was a pervert from the beginning, because they all are aware guys are all disgusting freaks. This is something men won't ever admit to, but they know is true - the only thing they care about is taking advantage of others. The fact that every single guy came out against her meeting up with this man shows just how much they have a coordinated language that only they, the fucking psychopaths, understand. It's not that they DIDN'T care about this girl, but instead knew what the outcome would be before it happened. They absolutely grasp just how repulsive men are, but can't admit it because they would have to call out each other - which they NEVER would do."
That age gap is insane?! A 13 year girl and 25 year old man! I think anyone would be shocked.
I would act like those guys if it was a 13y/o boy talking about dating a 25y/o woman. It's not men being aware of the danger - it's common sense.
"I don't think it has anything to do with men knowing men are bad, it's about knowing it isn't safe for a 13 year old to go meet an adult they met online. I would have reacted the same way."
"Also, that's pretty much illegal in most developed countries... As others have said, common sense. Any reasonable sane person would be alarmed."
We don't have high standards bro
what is a numale?
"According to Incel Jargon, a numale is a man who lacks self respect, who is completely devoid of any masculinity, and will defend women online for feminist brownie points while falsely believing that he will receive sexual favors."
"Their definition is already flawed since most dudes who ""defend women"" online are doing it because they geniunely believe in what they are saying and not cause they want to feel validated only. The validation is still there but there's a difference between that and not believing what you're saying and saying it just to feel accepted."
I agree. I just got the definition from Incel Terminology and put it in my own words.
"It's so sad that in my country, any man who believes in gender equality is called a numale, by the vast majority of sexist alt right people."
>vast majority of sexist alt right people. Maybe that's why lol
"Lol I phrased wrong then. I meant that in my country, most people is sexist and alt right. Both men and women."
In what country are you living? Seems kinda unusual tbh
"I'm Mexican, I indeed find it unusual, we're supposed to be a western country, but most people get upset about feminism, the LGBTQ, childfree women, men who respect women... At least not all people are upset about working women for now."
Lucky guy
"She is just a beautiful lady! This is why incels are despised, I think they don't want help. He is a lucky man to have such a lovely lady by his side."
Hmm... This short guy (who definitely can't get a girlfriend because he's short btw) sure looks happy considering he's dating a gross ogre.
Lol they call 'ogre' to this beautiful woman but they are the ones 'discriminated for their looks'?
"Beautiful happy couples that disprove their ridiculous theories, make them so mad"
She's hot idk what their talking about?
That is indeed a genuinely cute couple!
Man they look great together. It only proves that they are hypocrites. What is wrong with this couple.

"I'm reminded of the the movie Braveheart, where James Cosmos' character, Campbell, says, ""Armored rider, heavy horse, shake the very ground...

And rarely TWO calves.
"I dissected a pig uterus with a fetal pig inside. It was really sad but it was also really interesting. It was cool to learn what a uterus looks like (although Im sure a pig uterus looks a little different than a humans). But when I picked up the fetus I guess my motherly instincts kicked in and I didnt want to set it down. I was close to crying when the teacher pried it out of my hands. I wouldnt do it again, but it was a cool experience up until the end"
"... fucking hell. I'm glad I didnt see that. The pig fetus would be enough to upset me, much less someone clutching the thing and weeping."
when i was in 10th grade biology class some of the boys ate a little bit of the frog's tongue.
"ew, oh EW"
"i did try to warn them that it was full of chemicals to preserve the frog. even so, as soon as the teacher turned her back..."
"Similar story, cow eyeball instead"
My crime lab class did an autopsy on a fetal pig a few months ago. The teacher handed out straws to everyone so they could put it in the pigs trachea and blow in it so we could see the lungs move. It was really cool except for the fact that one kid inhaled in the straw
"Its cool to see how things like that function, but theres always one person that messes things up for everyone. One guy cut the penis off his pig and asked to take it home"
Oh my god its pig dick patrick
"Oh. Oh no. I doubt the teacher allowed him to take it home, but did he sneak it out of the classroom or something? My group finished early, so in the remaining time I used an X-acto to cut open its skull. It was hard to look at the pigs face while doing it though. But it was super cool seeing its brain and stuff. I have pictures and I try to tell my friends about it, but theyre never able to hear it or look at the pictures."
And does he think the uterus is always the size it is when its holding a fetus?
"Yeah mine is, that's how I keep two bags of Tostitos in there when I'm not pregnant"

"Here's my thing: I don't think politics should be removed from games, because you are forcing particular narratives to be silenced. And my particular viewpoint is that any kind of story and political view can work in a game, if the game cares to actually be a good game. Story-driven games need to focus on the stories itself, and not being preachy. Games can't sacrifice what makes it fun for the sake of a narrative. I dunno I'd like to think that if someone made a more awesome version of Dynasty Warriors but made it of any particular political viewpoint I'd be against, I'd still play it. EDIT: So others are pointing out that the content of the article doesn't fit the headline. I'll leave the comment, and accept my fault for not reading it (I blame work filter)."
"Headline and framing might actually be misleading, based on the words Sweeney actually said: https://twitter.com/notaxation/status/1227693707698343936?s=19"
"Thank goodness I can read Twitter at work...because I couldn't see the headline link. I mean, the dude's right. Leave the clickbait narrative to marketing departments, who are normally hit-or-miss anyway (I still recall this one ad about ""The game your mom doesn't want you to play."" that came out and was trash)."
I don't think he was talking about the game content itself... > Sweeney veered from the idea of games as a political medium and talked about the need for a separation of church and state model between politics and gaming. Sweeney argued that game companies should get the marketing departments out of politics.
"Most aren't against political themes in games, they are against games being used as preachy soapboxes that only show approved narratives. I love the Bioshock games and they are riddled with political themes."
"> Most aren't against political themes in games, they are against games being used as preachy soapboxes that only show approved narratives. I agree, and I'd reinforce that those games that were political were primarily enjoyable as games. Since you mentioned Bioshock, if the game held the same story but the gameplay was boring, we'd complain about it being preachy as well."
"I disagree. If it had been a walking simulator with some noninteractive cutscenes but none of the dialogue was changed, I would consider it boring, but not preachy."
"> I don't think politics should be removed from games Politics in games is fine. *mandatory* politics in games is not fine. If you're game is social justice bullshit, whatever, I just won't buy it. If you try and force *me* to include mandatory SJW bullshit in *my* game, that's a different story."
>**Epic Games Boss** Says All Politics Should Be Removed From Games suuuuuuuuuure
What always gets me is that the games media want the politics in video games until they are games with politics they don't like. &#x200B; Are there even any good games with right leaning politics in them?
"Paradox games tend to show that investing in your economy and conquering your neighbors is the path to prosperity, and cultural or religious diversity is a source of constant conflict that's best eliminated."
"No, they shouldn't, but it shouldn't be the same bull shit preachy nonsense that it always is. I'm tired of 'nazi bad, communist good' bull shit narratives, when communists killed far more people than nazis ever could or did even during the same time line and for worse reasons. How about a storyline where it shows how some one became a nazi or some shit, cause it's not out of fucking ignorant hate like people like. Something drives people to evil or wrong deeds where they see it as no other solution for an issue they have. Go over how WWI was a mixed bag of blame and who started it really is confusing to this day, but germany was given the shitload of blame for losing and despite multiple leaders saying it's a bad idea to blame them and punish them for WWI cause there'd just be another one after, left them a toothless, trodden, stepped on pile of turds by the rest of the world that they don't even blame them for. Imagine living in a country like this and seeing it constantly mock you. There's a snapping point where people don't care anymore after being picked on or stepped on for so long and so hard they'll turn to dark actions. Show why the south has a weirdly french cultural influence and all the reasons why the civil war happened. Slavery and why the south didn't want that to end just there. One of the main thing is that the south had a lot of french refugees from Haiti 60 years prior to the civil war when the Haitian genocide happened, when there was a slave rebellion that killed the french settler army. Then soon after a second genocide where all french women and children included were targets, they went house to house with this. Go over the basic concept of hate doesn't come from ignorance, it is a reaction to knowledge of things. It is not inherent, it is learned. Don't put some sort of dehumanizing lens of cartoonish evil nonsense on it constantly and understand why people turn to these horrid things. Basic fucking empathy to understand how to avoid it repeating. Every evil deed in history has been justified by the time it happened and the stakes it presented. Every evil deed reviewed by history is demonized or idolized by who ever controls the lesson plan for that day. Oh, and stop two things in every fucking game in the past: Every 'minority' group getting along fine, and the weirdo progressive main protagonist that thinks the other group of criminals is worse than them cause they're racist/sexist what ever. Every civil rights group has historically HATED each other. Black-civil rights groups hated LGBT as did the feminists, feminists called black-civil rights groups N-word constantly and complained that they let (word) vote before them. Hell, it's LGBT today not because it was chosen like that, it was originally GLBT for how many there typically is going down with the letters, but to stop feminists from hating gay guys they changed it to LGBT. Hell, feminism's proudest thing in american, Planned Parenthood, started by a super racist eugenicists who wanted to open a bunch of them to abort black kids mostly, and looking at their typical locations, they're doing great in that regard for her plan. The other weirdly progressive for his time protagonist thing. The worse thing you can do is kill some one. Because one dude is more selective/trigger happy when their target is a different shade doesn't magically make them better than the trigger happy ass hole who just kills cause reason. Being selective in who you murder doesn't make anyone worse for being a normal murderer."

What's her take on buttholes?
BRUH That's how you tell if a woman is capable of feeding the child. Just like how women with wider hips have less of a chance of dying during childbirth. Literally a blessing.

"Nah, they just didnt ask male homeless people."

"Most of those suicide victims are men. >When domestic violence related suicides are combined with domestic violence homicides, the total numbers of domestic violence related deaths are higher for males than females. ######Davis, R. L. (2010). Domestic violence-related deaths. *Journal of aggression, conflict and peace research*, 2(2), 44. https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html They also left out emotional, financial, and legal abuse."
It shows how many men do commit suicide if the murder rate is approx 3+times more for women.
Forced Marriage Unit?
They investigate reports of forced marriages. Fruits of multiculturalism.
"Since most people homeless are men...that should reveal something to people, as would the suicide statistic. Interesting they don't show the split on those issues."

"I searched for it (both written out and the acronym) on multiple search engines including ones which specifically search for papers. All I have found is people making the claim that this exists, usually in comment sections, not just without a reliable source but so far without a source at all. This almost certainly originated as a kind of hoax and may be spread by people who actually believe in its existence but refuse to fact check."

"Ok... Googling BRSS gave me La Base de remboursement de la Securit Sociale, which is highly likely not what this person meant. Googling the full name gives me such reputable sources as some woman commenting about the bible on an article about why the Equality Forum was boycotted. However! Googling all the names separately and adding ""lesbian activist"" gave me Julie Bindel, Janice Raymond and (I think) Marc Stein. I'm not familiar with any of these (though at least the first two don't seem to like trans people too much so keep that in mind), but I think I see what's going on here. So I'm now going to invent, I mean discover a very serious disease called the Shapiro-Kirk-Spencer Syndrome. It's a serious mental and physical disorder where after hearing too many angry white men yelling on youtube about Anita Sarkeesian, your brain will begin to leak out of your ears. It also attacks the brains capability of logical thought and reasoning. It's very sad. I mean, sufferers might even start thinking it's possible to sell flooded and underwater houses.

"Anyone else have an overall feeling of nostalgia when hearing 505? This is one of the few songs that genuinely make me feel a type of way. My heart clenches a little no matter how many times Ive heard it, even since my first listen about 6/7 years ago. Pic from their 2018 show in SF"
I'm going back to
"Think this is the source of the nostalgia feeling? I never really considered that this song was meant to invoke a feeling. Even when I was 14 y/o and never had even been in a relationship, I had this emotion of nostalgia of a romance (or something along those lines)."
"Stop and wait a sec, I always thought of this song like alex looking back at some old girl who broke his heart so 505 is like 5/05, the day of a date they had or something, meh just a theory"
"Wow! I love that idea, definitely could see Alex composing the song with the date concept in mind. Considering what a romantic he seems to be. Blew my mind !"
[deleted]
[deleted]
"I like 505 but I do not personally understand why its regarded as holy scripture around this forum. I think its a good song, but I think there are plenty of others that invoke just as much emotion. Oddly enough I think its one of the more Strokes-like songs they released. I love The Strokes, and probably moreso than the Monkeys. But when I listen to the Arctic Monkeys I kind of want the Arctic Monkeys vibe lol."
god it makes me feel like i miss an ex that i never even had. i feel ya
"I feel this way about a lot of songs and I always thought it was strange because nobody had ever talked about it. 505 is definitely one of the ones that makes me feel this way, Do Me a Favour is another, as well as Love is a Laserquest. Im not sure what it is but Im glad Im not alone in this feeling!"
This song makes my heart lurch...and it also makes me want to jump around. Good shit.
"This is my favorite arctic monkeys song. It has passion, heartbreak, optimism. Alex belts, the bass kills, I mean the organ bit is from the good the bad the ugly!! I love everything about this song. I think its about a relationship while on tour. As someone who was in a long distance relationship for 2 years, I binged this song then and think how far my fiance and I have come since everytime I listen to it. :)"
"I love the 2009 version. It's darker, and instead of nostalgia it makes me feel regret."
Agreed
505 is really something special in a way that i can't even explain. The first time i listened that song i cried. Like I FUCKING CRIED out of nowhere. There are no song now that makes you feel like it.

This does not sound too bad. What the worse that can happen with announcing sports?
I dont think you watch sports. Because they never on the announcers that much during the game.
I mean worst that could happen if it's an all female broadcast team including those calling which shots to use lol
True it just you ass shot thing is not a possibility
>The game will mark the firstNHLcontest broadcast and produced solely by women in the US It just goes to show that nothing will ever be enough. The fact that this is being celebrated as some breakthrough in female empowerment is ridiculous.
Could be worse

"I was on the fence, personally.

Frankly, I think his time and relevance were past expiration date anyway, even though his replacements haven't been particularly good either."
"> I think his time and relevance were past expiration date anyway Wow, look at this ageism. You apologize for censorship, colonization, and now think he should be sorry for comments to keep his job. How dare he pressure people into supporting the armed forces? That could be a trigger, so he should be pressured to never talk about them or the immigrants that only want to leech health care."
Luckily I have NHL.tv so I can just get the Philadelphia feed of Flyers Games and listen to Jim Jackson whose been calling Flyers games since 93 and Keith Jones who played for the Flyers.
"NBC has always, IMO had shit coverage of hockey. It is jarring to go from commentators for a local hockey broadcast to NBC. Suddenly instead of informatively talking about players and the game, there are constant stingers and stupid trivia filler like, ""This is the 5th time in history that the away team has scored over 4 goals in the second game of the playoffs."" And football-like yelling commentary with bullshit like ""That's coach Hockeyman, you know he's going to want his players to be offensive and score goals. He also isn't happy about the last penalty against his team. Whoa, the center just missed a shot, you can see he meant to get it in the net, but he didn't!"" EDIT: The worst is during the ""winter classic"" bullshit where they're delirious with joy that the game is happening outside and have to mention it every 90 seconds."

"Pretentious Indie Game SimulatorHi folks, I'm just your average non-binary/genderfluid/trans/differently-abled/autistic/immigrant indie developer from San Francisco. The last few years of my life have been very difficult . People have called me mean names on the internet for voicing my empathetic and well-researched opinion on the benefits of veganism. I received so many death threats and dick pics online that I wasn't able to focus on doing my job. I just couldn't manage to play and review the latest AAA games for 8 hours everyday. I was very concerned about my life and mental health. So I decided to quit my stressful job working as a part-time writer for a gaming website and moved back to my father's mansion in LA. It was very hard to go back to a life of solitude after having being used to the chaos of San Francisco. While I lived in LA, I had the extremely difficult job of catching up on all the backlog of games that I had reviewed at my last job without playing. Through this I discovered something about myself. I discovered my passion for copying other people's ideas and passing them off as my own. I knew what I had to do. I had to make my own game. It was literally the only way I could make my voice known. I felt validated when my first post about the game got over a thousand likes. I was so proud that my amazing idea resonated with my 15000+ followers on Twitter. I knew I was onto something special when all my game journalist friends retweeted all of my 74 blog posts about how difficult it was to learn RPG maker to make this game. The idea was so great that I managed to get the game funded without any sort of marketing at all! It just goes to show that a good idea is all you need to really create hype around your game. I'm proud to reveal that I've spent the last 7 months of my life working on my magnum opus. I've put up 3 months of wages on the line into buying the assets for this game. I work on the game all the time. It is so hard to manage with my offshore programming team due to time zone differences. When I'm not streaming obscure 80s DOS games in my pajamas from my bedroom, I am either engaging with the game's backers or trying to explain to my programmer who barely speaks English that I want the game to use a custom game engine to build the world's most high performance and cross-platform visual novel. I like to make games that express how I really feel inside. I like to express myself online because I can't do that in the real world due to my repressed, shy, and introverted personality. This game recounts the first heartbreak in my life when I wasn't asked out to the dance by my high school's quarterback and instead had to settle for a linebacker. It also deals with my childhood's most traumatic horse polo incident. It recalls the liberating feeling when I and my ex-girlfriend simultaneously got our third abortion. It tells the story of a fish out of the water, ignored, who jumps out to discover that the sunshine is just an illusion perpetrated by the capitalist patriarchy. This is my story. This is my voice. This is my soul. Game features: Monochrome pixel art A protagonist with depression! Lots of walking. Cryptic messages. Metaphors! Loneliness! Orange man bad! A whole 8 minutes of gameplay at a reasonable price of $10."

"I know how to solve many Physics problems, but I truly don't understand them? Like, I know how to get to the answer, yet the notion of ""comprehension"" is not there. I've been told I am ""good"" at math, yet the numbers that I see as answers don't mean nothing to me (besides being the answer itself)."
"So how can we help? Can you provide examples of questions you can answer mathematically, but do not understand?"
"And there is nothing wrong in it. It's just that you are not able to imagine the picture of your solution step by step as you solve them. Like solving a problem involving variable acceleration where it is difficult to imagine where actually it will move fast or slow, how the motion will look, etc. But you have your maths with you to help you with it. It allows you to find the REQUIRED answer of a problem without verifying every statement that comes before by sensing them."
I'm not a physicist but I am a engineering student who completed the physics classes. What has helped me gain an intuition solving problems is trying to tell a story with the equations. Also I think about things that happen in everyday situations and try to apply physics to them and think how they apply to the equations. Hope that helps.
"I like to encourage students to ""do the physics"" before writing the equations. What that means is to figure out what is happening, what physical principles apply, and be able to describe it. I believe very strongly that you (a) need to understand physics both with the ""gut"" (your intuition) and with the brain (the equations) and (b) can learn to do this, with practice. You already instinctively do physics every day without thinking about it. You assess the speed and trajectory of moving objects, you judge distances, you know what muscles to exert and how hard to jump or throw in various directions, etc. You just need to expand those instincts. I agree with others that some specific examples can help."
Keep practicing.
"Work on your intuition. Practice 'seeing the world with math'. By this I mean connecting your intuition with the numbers in the equation. Take F = ma as an example. What happens mathematically when m increases? (""m gets large, and either F must increase or a must decrease for the equation to hold"") What would that mean in the real world? (""the ball gets heavier, and if you don't push harder, then the acceleration will decrease."") &#x200B; By doing this you can slowly build an understanding of physics. Every time you see/hear something you don't understand, test your intuition. If you find that the intuition is wrong, do the math and adjust your intuition accordingly. &#x200B; This is the most fun part of physics, so it's worth the effort! :)"
"You might try reading something like Feynmans The Character of Physical Law. I thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas. Have you learned any calculus? I found I understood some things better when I looked at back after learning calculus. Beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations, while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived. Some people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life, and are able to get some sense of scale. This is particularly an issue in America where you might be using USC in day to day life but SI in the classroom. Mathematically, I can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 N should have an acceleration of 10 ms^(-2). Then think about something you can relate that to, 10 ms^(-2) is about how fast a dense object will fall, 10 KG is a small/medium size dog, or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store, 100 N is about the weight of that dog or onions. Highway speeds are around 28 m/s, residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s, a typical walking pace is around 1.4 m/s. Then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 N, you can think of that 700 N being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper. This also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 Kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above. Then again, sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions, or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways. Sometimes I found my skills grow when I would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones. For example, I might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but I remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question."
That's a mighty heavy assumption...

Yeah her shyness is cute and this is an incentive to be friends with her and protect her
"She's the probably the most different girl on the club. unlike other girls, she's complex and dark character. She's really mysterious and we don't know anything about her backstory. But sadly, people gives least attention to her. Maybe they prefer cute and cheerful girls or they scared of Yuri. Purple is color of royality and we Yurians are noble knights of our precious queen Yuri"

Yuri in her poems had complex words I think she likes philosophy and fantasy

"This is my dream. Like damn, if I only ever had to interact with women I would just forget my face is different and it would all go away. No males, no problems."
Same. Men actively exclude ugly women group discussions and then see us as cockblocks when our girl friends reject them. I try to spend time in women only spaces.
"The only reason I had a happy high school experience as an ugly woman is because 1) the woman around me saw me as no competition (there was a great deal of grief over the few town bicycles) and 2) in general, the lack of sexual tension allowed us to relate to one another without feeling like we were competing for male favor. It's pretty awful. You know what those studies say - boys benefit from being around girls; boys are detrimental to girls' education in turn"
Yess. I like my workplace bc its mostly women. Its just a supportive and understanding energy all around. I dont feel anxious about being judged or anything
"Until I took the blackpillI thought this was supposed to be a term of enlightenment, people on the old incel subs would say ""Feed him a blackpill before he ropes!"" or things similar.

You didn't ask to be born, you didn't ask to exist in this shitty looksist world. It makes no sense to me to beat yourselves up over being alone, especially if your blackpilled and acknowledge there is little you can do in the way of genetics. I was like you at one point in time; I hated myself and wanted to die for not being able to attract girls. However, that was when I was bluepilled/ redpilled, when I thought I actually had a chance. I truly thought the reason I wasn't attracting girls was because it was all MY FAULT, that wasn't being assertive, charming, charismatic or acting confident enough, not being enough of a haughty douche. Every time I developed a crush on a girl, I truly thought it was something I had control over, and that if I got rejected and saw her with some 6'5"" muscled-out gorilla- looking-man days later, it was because I had fucked up my presentation, that I had my chance with her but I blew it. Then one day, after the truth had chiseled away at me long enough to finally break me, I had finally became fully blackpilled. I won't go into detail how it happened; it took forever, a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario, best saved for another post. When I took the blackpill though, it was like a tremendous weight had finally been lifted. Not only did I stop hating myself, but I was able to move on and focus on other things that actually made me happy and love myself. I no longer cared what girls or really anyone thought of me; you'll never impress everyone anyway, so why get shook-up over it? For example, I was at the local archery range the other day, bettering my aim, when an attractive young lady walked in and took a spot near me. Now I'll admit, my natural instincts caused me to let my guard down and let her in my head. I instantly put pressure on myself to shoot really good and not mess up to impress her, which in turn of course stressed me out bad. But then I quickly came to my senses and told to myself, ""Even if I was the human version of Legolas, there's no way I could flatter her. That would only be if I was a 6'5"" muscled-out nordic chad. Hell, I could be complete shit at archery then, and she would be chomping at the bit to come over and assist me, so she could touch and adjust my arms and feel my muscles and shit."" And just like that, I calmed down, my mental state was restored, and I was able to go back to enjoying myself and focusing on shooting. Now I know some of you are going to say ""I wish I could have a girl adore me like that."" Or ""I'll never experience being touched romantically and sensually."" Well, so what? Why should you care if other people don't like you? If you haven't already, you'll come to learn that 90% of the people you meet are just a bunch of miserable dick-assed weirdos who only enjoy putting others down to make themselves feel better about their own shitty ass lives. They are not worth pleasing. Also, a lot of people won't get to experience a lot of things. Blind people will never get to see their own face. Deaf people will never get to hear their own voice. A few years ago, there was this four-year-old kid in my town who had to have all of his limbs amputated, or else this horrible genetic medical condition would kill him. Now he will never get to experience walking, running, jumping or playing, or opening his own birthday presents or taking care of himself or anything really for the rest of his life. My point is, yes life is terrible, yes life is filled with suffering, but that doesn't mean YOU HAVE to be miserable every second of every day. As a human being, you are capable of many more amazing things than you realize. As a 25 y/o virgin, I have found so many amazing things to do that made me realize just how amazing I am as a person, and they don't involve having a romantic partner; some of these activities are even more enjoyable when you're alone. Now I'm sure a lot of you are going to say that I'm just copemaxxing or something. Maybe you're right, maybe it is cope, but then again, maybe it's not. After all, some of these things, to me, like going on outdoor adventures, hunting, fishing, and hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT, feel BIGGER than just settling down with a wife and kids and becoming fully domesticated and tethered down like so many other people do. Plus, being single has it's advantages, like having a 0% chance of ruining your life by having a kid on accident. The bottom line is, you only live once, you might as well try and enjoy life while you still have it. If the ladies don't like you, then don't sweat it. IT is right, no one is entitled to anything, especially if it involves another person. After all, no one here would like being forced to do something against their will. If girls don't pay you any mind, then fuck it! Who needs them? You can't please everyone, so don't even try. Please don't live to try and please other people, does your one-and-only life belong to those assholes, or you? Live for yourself and no one else. When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on it! Normies will say that this is not a healthy mindset, but normies have proven themselves to be full of shit with their so-called ""advice."" Hating yourself and wanting to commit violence against yourself for something you had no say in is not a healthy mindset either. When someone takes the blackpill it shouldn't mean the end of their life, it should mark the beginning of a new one, filled with self-love and acceptance! TL;DR: Taking the blackpill should not make you sad, it should be and indication that you are free to live for yourself. It should disarm all of your self-loathing and tell you that most people are horrible and that their opinions are worthless. Do not just LDAR. Save the LDARing for when you're dead, after you've enjoyed your life to the fullest."
Just ignore thousands of years of evolution bro
Acceptance and being at peace with it
I am the blackpill
I dont hate myself. I hate everyone else(men and women).
"Blackpill makes me fucking miserable, but theres no going back. I cant really enjoy anything now either. Once you see the world for how it really is, its fucking over"
"Absolutely excellent brother, you have realized what it means to be an improover, and you are willing to enjoy what life has to offer. Come join us on r/SelfImprovementCels for likeminded people. We don't need women to make us happy bro, we need each other."
"Now I've recently taken the black pill I've become bitter and hateful towards everyone, including myself. I've now come to realise why people treat like me like I have no value. I'm on a course of self destruction, I don't care anymore. I give up, no matter what I do, my life will never be what I want it to be. Not even close."
"Your life is yours to do with as you please I guess, though it would be a terrible thing to waste."
Cholla cacti is unforgiving
Where does that grow so I can never go there
"Southwest US and northern Mexico. It's not a big deal, just avoid riding your bike into it like any other cactus."
This actually happened because of the new google maps cactus hack. Bicyclists are driving into cacti everywhere. It's an epidemic. Apparently North Korea is behind it.
Good
Get out of here you Kim Jung Un Cacti sympathizer!
"My boyfriend barely brushed up against one ball, and we had to pull 10 quills out of him. Its easier going in than out!!!"
Are we still doing phrasing?
> Its easier going in than out!!!
"As long as it is done with consent, take your time."
Thankfully coyote Peterson taught me how to deal with them
this person never dreamed of having that many pricks in them at one time.
It's called jumping cactus for a reason
Ugh I hate those things.
Why are men allowing such behaviour from women?
Because an idiot allowed her access to his property.
"After that shit, Id be coming after all her purses and makeup collection then Im kicking her ass out."
Fuck this cuck. He is a doormat.
"IDK why, OP. I know I wouldn't. I don't get why people get destructive when pissed off."
No man is allowing this. If any man did this he'd be thrown in jail. If a guy defended himself it means jail time.
Sounds like she needs to be evicted and then sued for property damage.
Hopefully ex-girlfriend.
"Because they aren't men, they are SIMPS"
"Read the comments, it gets worse."
Nice looking artistic wallpaper though.
Woman fuks two Chads from Tinder then complains about not finding true love.
Pretty dumb 2 months 2 guys And only 118 to go
"this. she got their attention by being easy. when guys ghost hard, it's because of a massive gap in SMV. either that or he got hit by a bus. and as we don't seem to be having a bus collision epidemic, it's definitely the former. i'm in my mid 30s and multiple single women i've talked to also in their mid 30s have all complained about the same shit. us mid 30s men who are well off and ""marriage material"" are dating mid 20s women. they can't get guys to stick around for anything more than a lay. so i told them: * go onto bumble and tinder * set up a profile with normal ass pictures that we take at the bar/party whatever. right now. no filters. not pictures from when she was all done up and filtered in a wedding party. what she actually looks like right now. * say in your profile that you don't get intimate with anyone outside of a long term committed relationship * swipe right on literally every guy * talk with every guy they match with. reiterate they don't get intimate with anyone outside a long term committed relationship. * now look at the guys who push to continue to get to know each other. literally 100% of the guys that they matched with they considered unmarriageable, and 100% of the guys they ""were attracted to"" ghosted rather quickly or never even messaged at all."
Shocking? Name one girl who isnt.. Ill wait *insert skelleton pic*
"she is on a good path and should just do the same thing the already did but try harder, and then with more experience at about 35 years old... aaah, yeah, whatever."
"She got the facts, and even know her future, this is not something it happens early, let's admit this just don't happen everytime. If she could look inside and asks what men want for a LTR and how she should be and act , maybe could see some light, but i am certain she will just go dick carrousel and blame all on men forever. To have more experience 'under the belt' will not help, on the contrary."
The hot guys she goes after arent interested in settling down. She doesnt want the men who do want to get married.
Poor girl...she has accurately described the next decade of her life. She hasn't figured out the wall yet....lol.
meeee
girl same but somehow that doesn't stop me from spending an inordinate amount of money on an intricate skincare routine
"Me af Spending money i should save for my future in expensive skincare products, researching and learning about cosmetic chemistry... and still having the worst skin of ANYONE i know of. Hyperpigmentation, PIE/PIH, atrophic scars, some breakouts here and there before my periods despite a round of accutane which left my skin very dry and paper thin (so, prone to prematurate aging on top of it all). Then i see girls who don't even moisturize and they have baby skin with no pores, no scars, no fine lines and a radiant complexion. To everyone, they look like clean put together girls and i look like i'm a dirty piece of trash who doesn't know how to clean herself. How unfair is that?"
"It's really disheartening to spend a lot of money on my skincare routine and still look like a river troll, while others are just naturally beautiful"
ikr!!
Off topic but where the fuck is this pic from? I've seen it used in a bunch of memes. What weird show is this? Edit: Of course it's Japanese. It's based off of a manga by Hagio Moto though who is a pretty awesome manga writer.
This is interesting
I hope she enjoys her newly-earned male privilege.
LOL. Getting a taste of what so many men go through and she doesnt like it. Welcome to the world men experience every day.
"[Alpha Women, Beta Men](https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9495/) > Once Anna sought a divorceYou know what my lawyer called him? A parasiteshe, like many other women in her position, was in for a shock. Divorce lawyer Harriet Newman Cohen explains, The law is supposed to be gender-blind. Therefore, when a marriage is breaking up at the insistence of either the breadwinning wife or the supported husband, the lawyer has to apprise the client that when a big-earner wife comes in, the court bends over backward to be gender-neutral, and it is possible the bum is going to be rewarded for sitting on his hands. You do a flip-flop and make believe she is a guy. > More often than not, this doesnt involve alimony. A lot of men, Ive noticed, feel embarrassed to ask for alimony, says Ken Neumann, since they already know their partners reaction. The wifes idea is, Youre not going to ask for alimony, are you? Its bad enough I was making more than you."
Sounds like she doesnt believe in equal rights.
"On the bright side, the fact that this is happening to one woman might lead to more states tackling it."
The comments are wonderful on that thread. Calling the men leeches and all sorts of deliciousness all the while not considering how often this happens to men.
"The same user says she's never marrying again, and a comment later says MGTOW is dumb. Also, when asked whether this experience makes her more empathetic to men, she says: > No bc men have for generations - and still do- use women as nannies and cooks and maids and then toss them aside when they get tired of them. The point of alimony is to help the spouse get back on their feet after giving up their lives to take care of the other spouse. > Slavery is illegal. When men pay: good and deserved. When women pay: slavery. I can't imagine seeing the world through their eyes and judging everyone's worth based solely on gender. Sounds miserable."
"Woah woah woah woah woah fuckin woah... Isn't that dude entitled to that money because of all the ""unpaid labour"" he did as a house-husband? That's how it works, right?"
"Marriage is ""our"" money, right? Or does that only apply when women cash out? Enjoy your male privilege asshole."
"Shoe, meet other foot."
I wouldnt be surprised if Im the near future laws will be made to make alimony something only dudes pay.
Doesn't feel fair does it o well girl it's your life now.
How the turns have tabled or something
"Went to the bar on Valentines NightSo as the title says, I went to the bar on Valentines with my friend because Im a man looking to find a relationship or casual sex. Couldnt go into the bar because my friend forgot his ID. Classic. I decided to be a bro and stay outside with him and try to get lucky that way (I live in a big city so 1am hangouts outside the bar is a possibility). There were two instances where I had a chance. 1.) Theres this very attractive blonde girl about my height with heeled boots by herself on her phone. Time to shine. I walk up to her and say, excuse me! I introduce myself to her. She does the same to me. I tell her that I think she is a very attractive woman as well as that I would like to get to know her. She tells me Im very sweet with a cute puppy dog face and tells me that she has a boyfriend and that hes picking her up soon. I say thats okay and that Id love to be her friend, so I ask her for her number. Que the boyfriend pulling up on a motorcycle and revving his engine for her to get on. She tells me thats him and I shake her hand as well as tell her it was nice to meet her and I walk away. About 3-5 minutes later I see the motorcycle drive off and same girl with other people hugging someone which appeared to be a friend, so I walk over to her and asked if she was just dumped to which she replies that shes just meeting him somewhere else. Looking back on that second encounter I feel stupid because I couldve said looks like I have a chance to get that number after all or something like that. Is there any other way I could have handled the second encounter? 2.) There was this other attractive brunette girl that kept exchanging looks with me, but I was too enveloped in a conversation with the group that I was interjecting myself in to go over there. Looking back I should have totally went over there for at least a moment. I was actually about to invite that girl into the group and she walked to the parking lot. How couldve I handled that differently?"
Well it seems like you know how you could have handled them differently lol
How else though? Im open to ideas.
Tact is an underrated skill which you lack. Being too aggressive makes you come off as desperate in situation 1. You pussied out in # 2. Timing makes a difference.
Tact? Teach me friend.
"Thank you! Ive been saying this since high school! Guys were always working against their own interests with that slut shaming bs. and that whole telling everyone culture, like I got so and so to give me a bj, really!? Well shell never do it again now that you needed to tell everyone."
I love you
thanks bro
"men don't ask out pretty girls because a rejection would become common knowledge in the villages of 150 people that our brains evolved in, and would hurt your mating prospects forever that reasoning doesnt apply today if you live in a city, but our brains dont care"
"There is truth in this post. I've dated a lot of hot girls, several of them models. I can tell you from experience that they actually get very little quality attention. The guys they might find interesting are always intimidated and afraid to talk to them, and the guys who do talk to them are usually douchebags who just see a pretty ""thing"" that they can impress with their boat or fancy car and then fuck and throw away. Yes, they have options, but they usually don't like those options and they tend to be lonely, frustrated, and desperate for a normal relationship. Once you truly accept and internalize this truth, and take the opportunity to treat a beautiful woman *as a person* rather than a collection of pretty body parts, you will often find that they are very receptive and quite lovely to date."
Definitely! It can be lonely and isolating for a lot of girls. Our job is to be the normal guy that treats them like a person
hypothetically
"For me, everybody's like, ""there she is!,"" or ""ask her out!,"" or ""get her number, quick!"", but I always respond with ""uh, no, I'm not that kind of person. I want to say hi and get to know her first. I don't want to be known as one who overburdens girls with requests or demands or thrusts upon her suddenly such duties in the first five or so minutes."" Oh and if your do wanna have sex \[insert girl's name here\], I'm Christian so wait."
"Tips for improving physical escalation?Background info: 22M. I noticed that I suck at establishing physical connection with girls during dates and fail to show my romantic/sexual interests fast. So it ends up seeing like I either dont like them or I am just not confident to make moves. I (more or less) tick other boxes like eye contact, questions, confidence, jokes and teasing etc. But when it comes to physical escalation, my game SUCKS. Firstly, I am not a touchy person in general. Even with close friends or relatives, I prefer to go for handshakes rather than hugs. Advice needed: How can I improve my physical escalation and make intentions more clear during first dates? I am also careful trying not to kill the vibes if I go touchy and then she does not appreciate it. I dunno how to work on this. Actionable and relevant advice from someone with similar issues would very appreciated. Thank you very much."
"Learn to be more of a touchy person. Atleast when you are in a private setting with a girl, not public. Like cuddling, putting arm around her, hand holding, stroking her hair. Literally anything like that. Why arent you a touchy person?"
"Thank you. Sure, If I get to that private setting I can escalate. Problem is before I get there, while we are still having coffee or dinner etc. I think I am not touchy largely because of culture and upbringing. I lived in Eastern Europe for most of my life and there being touchy with a stranger is not very common. After moving to US I realized I was severely lacking in this area. Also: I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves. In many cases girls dont initiate physical escalation."
"I've got similar issues. I grew up with no siblings and parents who showed zero PDA, even in the home. >I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves. I've learned that they're never going to give signs that they want physical moves. They will only give signs they *don't want* physical moves. If you are close to her and she leans back, she's not ready yet. If she doesn't, you can move to the next step. If she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers, lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them. She'll probably be okay with that, so move to the next step. Lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it. If she doesn't move her head back, you can continue moving up. If she does give a *no* signal, go back one or two steps, then work your way from there again. That's basically how it goes. Now what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses. If she's wearing heels, take her down a route with some stairs, and lock your arm into hers for ""support"". Go roller skating and take her hand. Teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body, under the guise that it's not *only* sexual touching. Kinda like innuendo in speech. One thing I'm keen to try, is at the first meet going for a handshake and instead bring her hand up to kiss it. I live in Japan, and 98% of the female population here goes apeshit over Disney prince/princess crap, so I'm curious how it would play out. From there I could probably go straight to holding hands."
"Great tips! Yeah sometimes I am afraid that if I make a move and they move away, I will make everything awkward from that point. But actually playing risky is safer because it will make intentions clear and nobody will wander later where they stand. In any case, if she likes you, she will reciprocate. There is not much I can do with my moves probably. Its also a mindset thing: I have to remind myself to take this risk just like I remind myself to be confident and ask questions."
"It's a big job so be patient with yourself. The book Rapid Escalation by Liam Mcrae is pretty good. There is also a huge compilation out there called ""Encyclopaedia of Kino"" where a guy summarizes *many* PUA books and courses with tons of ideas and techniques. Hard to find online ... wish it was a torrent."
Thank you. Will look into this. I guess I should just remember some kino moves and check off the boxes during the date.
"One of the old Lance Mason Pickup 101 video courses ... I forget which one ... has excellent demonstrations of creepy vs non creepy kino. He hired a group of girls, demonstrates good and bad touching in a pseudo night club setting, and gets them to provide feedback. If he does it in a creepy way they would go, ""Ewww that didn't feel good"". When he does it right, he literally has to tell the girl, ""Don't kiss me!"" because she's reacting so well. You can find these courses as torrents. Highly recommended."
"I'm only gonna comment because literally last night I was on a date and this was happening to me but I decided to make a corny comment about how beautiful she looked and then held her hand and made strong eye contact and it relaxed the f out of us both. In the next bar I made sure we sat at a booth close to each other and put my arm round her, rubbed her back etc. She started to reciprocate and then I went for the kiss and it turned us both on so much that I found it very easy to ask her to come back to mine. Man the key thing is sitting close to them at a venue. It makes the escalation much easier"
"Good job man! Its such a relief when both of you are on the same page. Makes everything easier down the line. I feel like when I dont make these escalations, it starts building up unnecessary tension and expectations. Like stakes go up suddenly."
"I know what you mean, but tension is good in the long run. There's also an element of risk that you have to take. Playing it safe has more often than not screwed me over lol. If she's really hot, there are other dudes waiting to try and get her out so it benefits you to be different than others who don't have the balls to go for what they want"
"Gotcha. Had a dinner date yesterday, but barely made physical moves. The rest went ok. Am I screwed or should I go for 2nd date and make more moves then?"
"Nah you aren't screwed, as long as you can get her out on another date, and go to somewhere more intimate so you are close together (rather than constantly being separated by a table etc) Honestly I think this detail gets overlooked but it's really effective"
We did dinner + drinks yesterday and it was an intimate setting already. My lack of physical moves made it less intimate. Thats why I am so pissed at myself So what can be a good 2nd date idea?
Lol Don't worry man. I'd go out again to another bar and try to move to your place (if that's possible)
People like this actually exist.

I.don't think bats have anything to do with this. She needs a long sleeved sweater that closes on the back.. and a padded room
There was rumors that the virus originated from bats/bat saliva. This is not confirmed and me referencing it isnt me saying that i believe that's where it originated from. Was just wondering if it was clever wordplay or not.
"Nah, I'm not that clever..."
Imagine the police believed her given the current climate over there. He would have been fucked over majorly. People like her disgust me. Trash.

"A question about how you knowSo Ive never had sex. I find the thought of doing it terrifying. I dont know if that makes me ace, or if I had such a conservative upbringing that it ruined my body image and now I dont want anyone to touch me. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience, and how they knew they were ace? I really want to put this to rest because I feel like I cant move on with my life until I figure this out. And I feel stuck because all of my friends are getting married or are married, and Im the odd wheel in every group. I dont want to feel that way anymore."
"Hi! I know exactly what you mean, Im a Muslim girl so Ive grown up in a very conservative household. Ive always been taught to hide my body and not date guys etc. you know what I mean. I first learned that I was asexual when another friend, also from a conservative Muslim family, told me she wanted to have sex with someone. This led me to think about how Ive never actually felt the need to have sex with anyone. Theres many more signs Ive noticed that I can relate with the asexual community, so I think Im more comfortable calling myself asexual now! Im still a work in progress, and Im still figuring myself out. I hope I helped a little :)"
"Its so nice to hear from someone who had almost the same experience! I definitely feel like I have an unhealthy relationship with my body because of the way I was brought up, but Im not sure it matters if Im never going to be in a relationship. I only learned about asexuality about a year ago. I certainly dont want to have sex now, but Im not sure if I ever did. I ask this as an Indian girl, what do you do when your parents want you to get married? My parents are getting to that point. I just dont know how to tell them."
"Okay omg Ive been wanting to talk to someone about marriage and asexuality. Lately, theres been a lot of rishta (suitors and all) talk in my house because Im almost of age. I know Ill have to eventually talk to my parents about my asexuality which is going to be maaaad difficult. But Ive been dropping hints saying I never ever want to be have kids etc. My parents just tell me to wait a little and youll be ready. Tbh I do want to get married, I just dont want to have sex you know. The thing is arranged marriages wont let me find the right person because theres a very very low chance that person is going to be asexual. It remains to be seen I guess. Im dreading the day Im going to have the conversation with my parents, but I know I have to do it."
"Me too!! My parents say the same thing, like oh youre young you dont know yet. Though that was a few years ago, I stopped mentioning it now because I dont want to write off the possibility of getting married but yeah honestly, what are the chances of them (or me) finding a guy who is also asexual? How awkward of a conversation would that be? Do you know how youre going to tell them? And its also scary to think that when you tell your future husband you dont want to have sex, theyll leave."
I admire your courage for asking. Im from a conservative Christian background (. Asexuality was a word I heard when I was a teenager. It sounded like me so I asked a lot of questions and did some research. It just makes sense to me. Self-evaluate and ask questions a lot. You arent the only one who has gone through this. Were in this together.
"Thank you for your answer. Did you ever feel like your conservative background made you dislike the idea of sex? I dont know if thats a common thing that happens that I need to investigate further. If its not, then I would be ace for sure. Im just not ready to call myself ace if Im not, because a part of me still wants that heteronormative life where I can go on double dates and couples trips and dinner for two. (I apologize in advance if this is an offensive comment. Im also still learning what aphobia is and how to avoid it in my speech/writing)."
"Its not offensive, dont worry. I dont think my conservative background contributed to my dislike of sex. When I hear sex talked about I hear that its a gift from God and a beautiful in the proper context. I think I just have a dislike for it. You could be a heteroromantic asexual. It means you are romantically attracted to people of the opposite gender as you but you dont want to have sex with them. Its what I am."
"I think I might be the same as you. But isnt it difficult to find a man who is okay with never having sex? I just cant imagine any man being okay with that unless hes also ace, and it seems like asexuality is much less common in men than women."
I have no idea. I havent been interested in or dated many men. I have a boyfriend right now but Im not sure how he would feel about it to be honest. I think he would be okay with waiting until marriage at the least. We will probably have several conversations about it. If he loves you he should be willing to wait. He should love you for more than your body.
"Hi! I dont grow up in a super conservative household, but I guess thought I should answer anyway. My family is catholic, so theres that. But my parents never made me think sex was a bad thing. Weve always tried to look at it in a positive, healthy light. Except I think Im asexual too. So in my experience, although Ive grown up thinking sex was a natural thing, it hasnt changed my attitude towards sex, and me not wanting it or feeing sexual attraction. Also, you can still be heteromantic! Which means double dates and romantic things with a partner are still something you can do while being asexual. Sorry if this isnt written very well, its a reply on the go! Good luck and feel free to ask more questions"
"Thank you for this! Its really helpful to see the perspective of someone who grew up in a more sex-positive environment. I am very doubtful that Ill be able to find a guy who is okay with dating but not sex. I see from this sub that its possible, but I just think the chances are so low. Unless hes also ace, of course, but there are much fewer men who are ace than women (according to the AVEN site)."
"This is actually quite common for aces and allos alike, But everyone is different. Theres no criteria for being ace. Just imagine yourself in a sexual situation and think about if you honestly want that to happen or not. And remember that if you choose to say you're asexual and later find out you're not, then you're just not asexual! There's no damage done to the community by misidentifying yourself and you won't offend anyone by changing your labels. They are, after all, just labels."
"Thats good to know - I partly dont want to label myself ace because I dont want to change my mind later and have people be like oh, asexuality just means you havent found the right person! Which would be damaging to other ace people they might know. For me, if I were to come out as ace, I feel like my parents would sort of give up on me having the normal life we all always thought I would. Theyre great people and theyd support me, but I think theyd be sad deep down that I wont have biological children. Thats why I dont want to come out until Im absolutely sure. And I almost feel like I cant be sure until I do have sex at least once....though thats hard when I havent met anyone Id like to have sex with, haha."
"1) it doesn't so much damage the community as it could damage you. The fact that you're even considering the possibility of being ace is mad respect to the community, and changing your label later isn't disrespect. Its self-discovery, and its good. 2) if you come out to people and you don't think they'll be 100% supportive, explain to them that everything else is exactly how it would be if you were allosexual (meaning not asexual, ""normal""), there would just be some difference too personal for them to be knowing about 2a) if its your partner, that's something they definitely should know about. If they really care about you, they'll respect your identity and what that means for your relationship. If they don't accept you, they aren't worth it. And just remember that being asexual doesn't mean you aren't worthy of love or that you won't ever be loved. It just means the person who will love you is gonna be that much better of a person."

"Annoyed by music talking about ugly women.Songs like 24K magic or Psycho, theres more that Ive heard too that mention ugly girls. Had so many bottles gave ugly girl a sip for example. Lookism is everywhere and its so tiring. At the end of the day it doesnt really bother me cause I know Im ugly and thats just how itll always be, Ive kinda made peace with it, but Im just annoyed that its such an importance placed on women. That I will always have less value simply because I dont fit the standard for what beauty is. (And the fact that its bad genetics, something I cant really control). I listen to music to escape from my problems and even then I end up being made to feel like shit. Im annoyed."
"Fun fact... Well I wouldn't really call it a fun one, but ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" was code in rock clubs for no pretty girls at the show that night. When the song came on I know it wasn't their intention but it brought back memories of hearing guys say that in passing. No one ever really talks about rock being part of lookism, especially hard rock, but it is. We just see the misogyny in hip hop more. I can cite a few sources that claim emo post hardcore music that was popular in the mid 2000s has just as many instances as urban/rap video ""hunnie"" culture."
That's awful because when I hear that song I think of how I was living in NYC at the time and the Mets used that as their Subway Series anthem. It brings back happy memories. To know it's a song putting down women like me... :(
I've never even actually paid attention to the lyrics of 24 k magic lol... Its so generic and bland. But I get what you're saying.
"""Lookism is everywhere and its so tiring."" This sentence is revelatory. It articulates the knowledge femcels carry with us that poisons...even trying to take solace in music. Like the smell of shit. It's haunted me my whole life. You articulated it so simply and so beautifully. Books written by men; songs; movies (obviously). Not just opining about women existing to look fuckable; the sin on the world cast by ugly women. Movies, day to day conversation (as men forget you are there, bound to), even women talking amongst themselves. Yes, Looksism is everywhere."
"I mentioned this before about a song like 24K. I remember listening to the song and vibing to it until the secongld verse came around. Leave out being smart, beauty is prioritized and expected to be the most important thing for women."
"The flipside is all the songs praising 'beautiful/pretty girls'. Knowing that these songs could never be about you. The emphasis on looks, looks, looks all the time."
Yeah that kills me too. Its like every other song out there is about how beautiful a girl is. Annoys the shit outta me.

"The biggest Asshole move a guy did to young femcel. Feel free to share your story.This all happened about 5 years ago... Somewhere in Southeast Asia... We were all in high school age... It started with my cousin, the light skin Chad-lite. His friend, the normie 6'0"" basketball player. And, the young femcel who was about 14-15 years old. She was brown skinned with severe acne problems. Her dry hair is always at chin length and never grew. All of us knew each other because we lived in the same area and played together. Then I moved to Toronto. One day, cousin called me and CACKLED about what happened. He told me that Basketball player, femcel and him went to the outdoor flea market together after school. The femcel suddenly disappeared. They didn't waste a second to wait for her. ""Bro, let's go!"" his basketball friend told him. So the him and his friend left her there and went home without telling her. I asked him. ""Bro, why!?"" He said. ""Who the fuck am I to wait for her!? She's not even pretty!"" Well, that was mean. Fast forward, the basketball player asked her out, for God knows why. She agreed. He never brought her anywhere in public. Never held her hand. Never showed her affection. You wanna know why? My cousin told me that. ""He dated her because he wanna \*have sex\*."" Out of every place he could've done, he broke up with her in the CROWDED market after HE TOOK HER VIRGINITY. She ended up breaking down into tears in public in front of at least 100 people. My cousin was cackling, telling me all this. I feel so bad for her. My cousin still not understand a reason on HOW I BECOME A HEARTLESS PERSON. Well, it's because of shit like this..."
Douchebag men: treat ugly women like utter human trash Ugly women: become jaded and mean Douchebag men: surprised pikachu face
I think the one who had sex with the femcel is the normie friend.
He's not a Chad. He's a normie with HUGE ego
"For some guys ""a hole is a hole"" and that's what they're desperate for. The girls' feelings or looks aren't important to them."
My country is very open about sex. This normie basketball player was just desperate...
I know that something similar would have happened to me if I hadn't been extremely shy/reserved.. that is exactly what we are talking about when we say that having sex as a femcel or even entering a relationship might be possible for some of us but most of the time it's humiliating and traumatizing it's much worse than being alone..
"Wow. To be honest, the worst part for me is when they leave her in the market. I mean, it's not a matter of like/not like, it's a matter of basic human consideration and safety. Any amount of bad things can happen to a young woman on a busy market (well, any person, but especially a young girl), and her sudden disappearance would be a legit reason for simple, humane worry in any non-shitty person."
Its always dangerous to trust a man as an ugly girl. 9 times out of 10 theyre just trying to humiliate you. So sad and what a horrible boy
"The shame after being lied to and just used is real and imo, not talked enough about. I'm sorry this happened. And then people wonder why we're reserved and protect ourselves from potential harm."
"Males do this shit all the time and then brag to each other about it. Just read the normie male subs on here, there's plenty of them that just speak of using ugly women for sex and then whining about how THEY feel bad because they can't get anyone better. All about them and their ego, fuck her and her feelings, she's ugly so who gives a fuck. And this attitude will bleed over into every area of their lives, that's why males are so shitty towards ugly women outside of relationship context as well."
"Yeah, PLENTY of men won't have any qualms about briefly sticking their dick in a girl/woman they're not really attracted to, if she's offering. It's just they won't particularly like, respect or care about her, and they won't tell their friends or anyone they respect about it, unless they can brag about it being an act of contempt."
That's what they do. Use ugly girls and leave.

I wanted to post my post on foreskin restoration/dekeratinization. But the feminist mods of r/sex told me literally no one cares what an MRA intactivist thinks. Really? Im not so sure.

If no one cared they wouldn't need to censor you.
That aren't feminists they're simply sexists
What's the difference?
"Genital mutilation is disgusting. Let the male decide later on in life if he wanted it or not. I was never cut as a child and I am glad because I got to experience it and know that it's not for me, but we should have that choice, not our parents!"

This is what equality looks like.

Johnny Depp makes surprise appearance at London's High Court as he sues The Sun over column branding him a 'wife-beater'
"> The Suns lawyers are demanding that Heards evidence be heard in private, which is being opposed by Depps team. A separate hearing to resolve the issue will take place before Marchs libel trial gets underway. Cheeky fucks, like a lot of newspapers they don't want to have to publicly admit they're wrong so they can throw men like Johnny Depp under the bus and carry on with business as usual like with fake hate crimes. I would love to take all these tabloids to task over their outright glamorising of female paedophiles and teacher paedophiles especially. They have done a huge amount of damage to gender relations generally with their belittling of men's issues."

"[No Spoilers] Why even call it Season 6?Just bitching about the ridiculous break time just like last year. In reality, the last 4 seasons of Vikings are 10 episode seasons. Not 20. Not season 5a and 5b, 6a and 6b. It's seasons 5, 6, 7, and 8. You can't take a 9 month break and tell me it's still part of last season. This break time is ridiculous and just a way to draw the series out longer when the episodes are likely already finished. Just give us the whole damn season, damnit. Why make us wait 9 months and deflate all of the series momentum to give us a measly 10 more episodes? If the series controllers are going to take such long ridiculous breaks they should at least be honest with the way their number their seasons."
"Its really annoying and confusing. I watch with my dad at irregular intervals (whenever Im home from school) and its hard remembering if weve seen 5a or 5b or whatever. 10 episodes is plenty for a season, why not just call them different seasons"
"If I remember correctly, legally they can pay them less (no negotiations) if they film 1 season of double the amount of episodes. So film 20 episodes while calling it the same season and they don't have to enter negotiations for salary raises and such."

"Honestly, I was watching what happened to Bjorn happen, checked to see that it's the final scenes, and was like wtf so that's how they end it? I had forgotten about the 5.1, 5.2 thing and was enraged that they would end it like that."
Agreed
They started doing that in season 4 the same time people started noticing the writing being....Ill be nice and just say off. Maybe its related?
"Totally agreed. Season 5 to 4b, season 6 to 5a, 7 to 5b, 8 to 6a and 9 to 6b sounds much better. Almost lost myself in typing this comment."
Probably had 6 season contracts with some cast members who didn't want to renew. Five to seven seasons is often the length of TV contracts for lead actors.
"So I am watching season 4 part 2, but its actually season 5, thats what you're saying?"
"Yeah the filming was done in August 2018, by the time the 6B comes out, actors would have watch the 2 year old footage of themselves which is ridiculous"
"Filming for 6b was done in November 2018, not August."
"Yeah, my mistake, still, they probably have all of the episodes ready, they are just prolonging the show, I see no reason why the break should be a year, 6 months would be a perfect amount of time"
"Yeah youre right. Its basically eight seasons so far and nine when 6b is released. Whilst the breaks are annoying, at least we get a season (half) every year. Other shows like Peaky Blinders and The Last Kingdom are the worst with breaks. Always more than a year for a season to release."

"Being a femcel is about completely suppressing your interest in anyone because you know no one will ever like you backsaw a post that said ""being a femcel is about having 5 crushes at once because no one will like you back"", but that doesn't match me."
"I am 30 years old. This is the story of my goddamn life. During my school years, the three guys I ever had crushes on made fun of me for ever daring to lay eyes on them. In college I liked one guy but it clicked that he was only talking to me so he could practice talking to other women. Apparently he had lost a lot of weight his senior year of high school and he was now starting to get attention from women. I avoided him so much after I found that out. At my current job, there was my boss...wow he was so sweet and handsome, very friendly too. I crushed hard for two years. He has a girlfriend now and Im over it...thank god, sometimes I still get really nervous around him, I think he knew I liked him. Right now I have a massive infatuation with one of my coworkers. I have always initiated conversation with him, he never even looks at me anymore. I think hes avoiding me, he might know that I like him. So yeah. Thats me...men avoid me and thats how I confirmed Im ugly."
"Yep and then it turns you into a mentalcel too because even if a man genuinely was interested in you, you dont know how to turn off the learned dont offend men by showing any romantic interest behavior or the suspicion that youre practice until they feel confident enough to move on."
"Lol, yeah, I consider it impolite to a person in question. It's like, I don't think romance has something to do with me irl. It's not available at my level of existence. The extend of my ""love life"" up to this day, to my overripe age of 30, is wanting to be friends with some male nerds in school. Actually friends. But one pair looked funny at me when I tried to talk to them (they lent me a video game tho). And the other pair of bookworms, who sat behind me, exchanged notes with me at tests, but when I one time misguidedly replied that I am also a girl when they discussed how there were no girls around, one of them murmured in disagreement that he ""had seen women much better"". I got the idea about my place in the girls hierarchy, though I still stupidly believed that I can have casual convos with guys for some time after. I haven't fallen in love so far, thankfully, and I hope it will continue this way. It's like, I can appreciate a handsome man, it's a pleasure to look at one, but I don't make it personal, try to curbstomp the emotion in me and remove myself from the situation. It doesn't feel like something for me."
"Making male friends as an ugly woman is something that just doesn't seem to happen anywhere, but particularly around nerds. Contrary to popular belief, they are much more shallow than regular males and have extra misogyny as well for blaming all their own inadequacies on women. They tend to have more inadequacies than other males so more blame to externalize. You're lucky you like video games though, that's way better as a form of initial, fun bonding than talking about the stuff in class which is all that I have. It's interesting to me but seemingly to nobody else:D"
"I've embarrassed myself so much by flirting with and asking out guys. I have to mentally restrain myself from flirting. I try to avoid high alcohol environments because of it...I tend to scan the room and go for the guys who are hanging out alone and/or seem the ""easiest,"" they become visibly uncomfortable. they must feel so disgusted when I approach them. Its embarrassing."
"Yeah. I told myself to just dont talk to guys unless its a work or professional thing. In the past, so much has happened to make me this way. I definitely learned my lesson."

"Ive been through the stage of trying to not like/crush on any guys cause I know they would never reciprocate, but that was just a phase/coping measure. I really do want a guy to want me back the same."
"You could honestly find a LVM who just wants any warm body to fuck, so I don't think it's exact to say no one would like you back. If you didn't mind being used for sex by someone who brings nothing to your life, you could be liked back. But I understand that's not true love."

">Even if it's true that there aren't any openly, media-facing conservatives in the gaming press, it doesn't prove that some clique is keeping them out. I corrected you on this horseshit the last time you peddled it. It's not that the utter lack of conservatives proves there is a clique. It has been *claimed* by an inside source that there is such a clique, and the existence of ONE NAME is all it would take to disprove the allegations. And they can't do it. >Just as the lack of black superheroes proves that Hollywood is keeping out black people, 1.) The lack isn't total, there have been several black super heroes, and 2.) Hollywood is on the record as constantly bending over backwards to prove how woke and diverse they are. Compare that to the games journalists who can't give us ONE NAME and who are on social media continually acting in exactly the ways an anti-conservative clique would in fact act. If there wasn't a single black super hero in Hollywood and famous actors and directors were on Twitter constantly talking about how much they hate black people, then maybe you'd have a successful analogy.

"I need this to happenThat boy Boruto powered up by Karma with Jougan active to see the weak spot in the enemy, uses gentle fist like sixty-four trigrams type shit. Bonus if he adds lightning or teleporting some how. OP"
As soon as borutos jougan becomes a normal thing he needs to learn chidori I think that fits him better than rasengan tbh
"Theoretically, Jougan should make up for Chidori's downside right?"
It should since it spots weak points
I'm referring to Chidori's speed and the poor reaction time that a non-Sharingan user would have
"Yes, remember the Momoshiki fight when he was able to predict his attack and dodge"
I do not see how the chidori would fit him better then his family jutsu... just because he has lightning release and it's Sasuke's student?
"That's more than enough reason to at least learn it, the rasengan will still be his signature attack."
"with this logic then Sarada should learn the rasengan merely because she can and Naruto inspired her to become Hokage... I do not think that he should learn such move (assuming he could move fast enough to begin with) merely because yes... it's too much of an iconic move and he already has one.... I know that he should have more distinctive moves from his dad, and I agree on that, but rather than giving him the same jutsus Sasuke has, it's better giving him ones that neither of them have been showed using, so he can stand out more (the weaker puprple chidori, more suitable for everyone who doesn't have the sharingan, would already be better, since Sasuke has no reason to use it)"
I would also love if we get a new jutsu using the jougan
"-Totally agree with the red weapon chakra thing. -I know that... Ikemoto should really have him use more than a mere rasengan in the next fight where he'll have the more central role, like the Hyuga Taijutsu, or his own Boruto stream... (the last one was the Ao fight, and it was nice seeing him use a sword) -I know the perfect way to make him stand out while not being either a mini Naruto or Sasuke 2.0 : JUST PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON THE HYUGA TAIJUTSU AND GIVE HIM THE BYAKUGAN!"
"He already learnt the basics basics with Hinata, so it is probable he will use some form of Hyuga taijutsu, if they don't forget he is a Hyuga... again."
"I would want him to have a new jutsu of his own. I am sick of rasengan/chidori. Since its a new dojutsu, it would be way better for him to have a technique unique to his power. Like how you can use gentle fist with byakugan, it would make it even more interesting if he finds a new technique of his own. How does dimension manipulation sound ??"
Kaguya already did it.
> Bonus if he adds lightning or teleporting some how Bonus if he spasms a rasengan as the 64th on his opponent's chakra point!
"I hate being a wagieBeing a wagie is complete suifuel. I just can't take it anymore. I have to clock in in an hour and I'm probably just going to quit my job. I just can't fucking take it. This would be the third job that I have quit. I swear to God being a wagie makes me suicidal. Every day while at work I always fantasize about taking a shotgun and just blowing my brains out. I'm seriously thinking about NEETmaxxing. Idc if people see NEETs as losers, I'd rather be a NEET than a wage slave. God I swear I miss being a carefree kid sometimes. I miss the days where I woke up and had the whole morning to myself and I just spent the day outside with the neighborhood kids building forts in the woods, playing baseball, kickball, and dodgeball, having Nerf wars, playing tag, playing hide and seek around the neighborhood, or just riding our bikes without any care in the world. Fuck I miss those days. I truly don't understand how normies can stand being a wagie without wanting to hang themselves. I can't believe this is the system our ancient ancestors created. What the fuck were they thinking? It just saddens me that I'm going to be spending the rest of my life wage slaving."
Normies can do it because they know when they get home someone who loves them is waiting
"Most normies don't find love. Sure, normies have had sex before but often they marry someone who never or rarely has sex with them. Just take a look at /r/deadbedrooms"
">stay at home moms Stay at home moms aren't doing nothing, they're taking care of the child. Usually also keeping the house clean and running the household errands (grocery shopping, etc.)"
"They're doing chores like everyone else, what do you think employed people do. Every NEET can give you a list of their activities at home, everyone's technically doing something"
If you become a live in nanny you'll basically be just chilling in someone elses home and making money
"Being a nanny isn't ""chilling"", you have to take care of the children."
"Kids are hard work, why do you think daycare costs so much?"
Looking after a child alongside running a home is not the same as doing chores. I know men who have been stay at home dads for a while who have said they couldn't wait to go back to work because they found it so difficult.
"i feel you. i'm in the same situation. i have a lot of free time there, like the others, but i don't want to talk to them, because they are all bluepilled, and all they do throughout the day is laughing. i keep scrolling work vacansies every day, hoping to find environment that suits me more."
"Save your money, buy a one way ticket so some sketchy third world coastal country and live on a beach the way you want. What do you have to lose?"
"Learn Spanish. Your local court house pays $40 an hour for translators. Or you know, complain to Reddit that you have no marketable skills."

[News] Ex-Gawker editor sues Daily Beast over story portraying her as racist
Archive links for this post: * **Archive:** https://archive.md/oxyeI ---- I am Mnemosyne reborn. Praise the Sun! \\[T]/ ^^^/r/botsrights
"What goes around comes around and a large part of Gawkers business model was doing the same shit to others. All in all, I really don't care whether DBs specific allegations are true or not, but I'm damn certain she never ever called out her own publication for pulling similar shit."
While I feel for her because her comments were out of context.... It's a fucking Gwaker editor who makes a living taking things out of context.
"Would be interesting to research her past stories and see if there's specific cases of her doing that. Especially if she had portrayed others as racist with out-of-context quotes and such. Then, if there are, bring them up directly to her and say ""not as fun when you're on the receiving end, huh?"""
This will be interesting to keep tabs on.

"[Repost] Unattainbles - A Core Element of Masculinity**tl;dr won't usually do this for you, but this one is easy** Simply put: In order for a man to be happy and at peace, he must have a presently unattainable goal. ------ Let's jump right into it. Your personal deficiencies are going to be very different from the other guy (and your past self as you grow up and evolve). To expound on the second point, what I cared about at 17 was of the utmost importance to me at 17, but has no relevance to me now. Likewise, my expectation of achieving the goals I set for present-day me would be outrageous at that time. That means in plain English that my mission in life at 17 was as follows: * Graduate high school * Hold on to the relationship with my girlfriend My unattainable at 17 was: * Get into my ""dream"" college When the unattainable is achieved, something new must take its place. **Failure to do this creates existential agony until an appropriate obstacle is in place to calm that nerve once again**. What do I do now when I achieve what felt like the unattainable? I invent a new unattainable. However, this lesson took some time to learn. My college mission was as follows: * Break up with high school girlfriend * Make grades * Rush the fraternity I wanted to be in My unattainable at the time was as follows: * Yep, nothing. This is where my journey stalled. I never bothered to think past my last unattainable into a new one! After all, I had already done the impossible. I was perfect and needed no further improvement in my mind. I briefly got back together with the high school girlfriend long distance. It was, as my football coach put it, an ""other than positive experience"". See the problem? ---- This applies to men of literally any age. I use a teenage example because it will resonate with boys and men alike, but the message is the same: whether your limitations are sex, money, power, wealth (believe me, that is different than money), or fame (a thing many people hamster into attaining the other 4 aforementioned), you need to understand that without some seemingly unattainable goal to strive for you will never continue to be a man. The core act of being a man involves becoming a different man worthy of surpassing self-defined milestones. The unattainable should be a combination of ""a thing you've never done before and have limited hope of achieving RIGHT NOW"" and ""things men you admire and respect have done before"". Fortunately for our dear readers, many are probably major losers right now. This unattainable can be as low as ""kiss a new girl"" or ""earn a promotion / earn $46,575 a year"". THIS IS A GOOD THING. Your self-actualization depends on actually achieving these goals, *just not in your current mindset, body, or frame.* For the avoidance of confusion, your current mission should be: 1. Specific 2. Measurable 3. Attainable 4. Relevant 5. Timely Your current unattainable may or may not be any of these things - you have the freedom to decide. The only requirement is that the unattainable must be grand enough that you are currently unworthy. Hold yourself to this principle, and you will evolve rapidly into the man you want to be."

Anytime someone uses the word 'females' instead of women (unless it's like a in scientific context) it makes me cringe
"It looks like it's supposed to be in a scientific context as she states she has a bachelor's in medicine and a bachelor's in surgery, but that makes things all the more concerning"
Yeah I suppose so. I should've put that it's only not cringy when reffering to animal species. Can't really recall the last time I read an article where they refer to women as 'females'.

Oh dear. That bottle of water I drank is going to sploosh straight through my empty innards with the force of a fire hose and knock my uterus out of place. Oh no.

Use an electric shaver and start atleast a month out I'd say. Using a razor was rough. Irritation and ingrown hairs were real bad.

And why women only gyms are fine but not men only barber shops.

"Yeah would be great probably, but I don't mind much. Actually I think Instagram makes it easier for girls and women to be discovered and become a successful model or actress without having to rely too much on accident or casting. She looks like a natural Kendall Jenner."
"You know she was already famous from dance moms, right?"
she wasnt on dance moms. are you thinking about that girl from the movie tall girl?
huh i swear i saw someone who looked like her on that show....
she looks like a normie tbh
No way
I see more attractive girls every day at college. Some are impossibly pretty. This girl's face looks normie to me. Maybe just my opinion
"Im watching a Mabel video right now, would you agree Mabel is as pretty as it gets? Yeah theres prettier girls for sure. But the girl pictured still looks good to me"
"Imo she was just lucky. Her face is ok, her body is normal like nothing extravagant... tbh Ive seen prettier girls in my university"
Nothing about her stands out
not to invalidate your feelings but it's kind of strange to be focusing on how pretty she is because she's underage and i know grown men lust after her. it freaks me out to perpetuate this kind of shit
so because shes underage i cant acknowledge the fact that shes pretty? lmao what are you trying to imply?
"Guy's kid gets aborted, the lack of empathy is deafening."
"She'll still find some way to blame you tho, if that's any consolation."
"My body, my choice is definitely a flawed ""slogan"". It does ultimately make it seem as if a woman is removing like an ear or toe of her choosing. Even if someone is pro-choice, they should be clear that it's a separate body that they are killing/terminating. That doesn't make people comfortable though, so they ignore that for a slogan that doesn't address it."
"I'm agreeing that a fetus/baby is not a woman's body. I do think however that the reasons for abortion are not as simple as not wanting morning sickness. Just like the reasons a man would want a paper abortion ultimately vary. Regardless, I would never kill a child in my body."

I believe abortion makes more sense when a female either got raped or her life is at risk. Now day's it's becomes more normalized. When when two people have sex with or without condoms or not using a contraceptive pill and she becomes pregnant it's both their responsibility to upbringing the child. Financial situation etc is just another excuse to abort the child.
"Right, except children aren't an inconvenience. They are a complete and total shift in the way you live your life, if you choose to raise them. That can be for good or for ill, but if someone does not want to raise children, I think it's best for the next generation that only people who actively want to be parents are. I would prefer it if people acted like goddamn adults around the subject of sex, and treated it with the respect it deserves rather than a casual evening's entertainment. I also realize that there are enough people unable or unwilling to do such. I am willing to live with abortion as a result. If your girlfriend has an abortion and you did not want to be in a relationship with someone who would get an abortion, you did not ask the right questions and get honest responses before having sex. Maybe make sure the person you want to be in a relationship shares your values and goals BEFORE undertaking the act that creates children."
"They gave him the right answer to his simple legal question as it stands under the current law. He didn't seem to be looking for comfort in any obvious way. I guess you mean they didn't have ""sorry for your loss"" added to their answers?"
So you think he was happy that his kid was aborted without asking him? Why seek legal advice then?
"Why do go to an extreme? I don't think he's happy about it, that makes no sense. There are a complex set of feelings one could have about this situation that run the gamut, but nothing he said pointed to me thinking he was happy. However, nothing he said pointed to him wanting comfort from strangers either. He also posted to a legal forum. Doesn't sound like a place where people will offer comfort, only legal advice. Correct me if I'm wrong and the community there usually expresses empathy in their answers."

It's not worth it. I was depressed all throughout college and due to this never got an internship in my major and I am now a poorcel at 25 (graduated at 21). I am a college graduate but a poorcel.

basically just to get a less shitty job to grind your pointless life with
"Im in a similar position, basically 0 motivation and thinking about one person every day, wishing I could just drop everything and go after them. Yet, studies come first. Get your degree.

I know its hard but try to think about the long game. Dont drop the ball just yet. Good luck man!"

"You don't need a girlfriend to be happy dude. I know this will sound like a cliche but its true, just live in the moment. You need to look at the positives, you got into university, not everyone gets that chance. That means you must have worked your ass off to get in there, and that's something to be proud of. Anything can happen in the future, in 20 years time you could be living in another country enjoying life. Or you could be in the exact same place as you are now with a family that loves you. Dwelling on shit that doesn't matter isn't gonna help you. C'mon you got this far, power on and things will change whether you want it to or not."

"Rejection does not make you any less of a man.I have approach anxiety right and I am in the process of accepting, learning and loving myself. I have always had an issue about my looks and that has really stifled me in taking action because I know, Ill get rejected. Hear me out, for a 30yr old hard-case newbie, rejection hurts a ton. So yesterday, I went to a shopping mall, did some shopping and went out to another store to make an account payment. Whilst there, I was spoke to the girl who was assisting and at some point we had a moment of banter and I was like okay, maybe I should ask her out. Once I did the payment, I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and I got a no. From there I said, its ok, I understand. Weirdly enough, I felt good and I was okay with her choice. Her rejecting me didnt make me any less of a man. My mental critic tried to spin it off to say she rejected you because of your horrible crooked teeth (Im getting braces next month) and your horrible face but all I knew was, I was getting somewhere and being rejected doesnt make me any less of a man. Ill try to face my approach anxiety and continue to grow. Im really proud of what I did. Thanks."
Speaking to a girl who works in the Shop don't count as approach. Don't do it. She is in difficult position.
I know but how are going to know if you dont try. Progress brother.
"It doesnt count as a try either. I have red (but didnt do) this : Go to a mall. Make eye contact and smile to people while you are walking around. Next Day you can add a ""good morning"" to them."
"Well, Im aware but thanks anyways."
"hey man it's great you're getting out of your comfort zone but I recommend not asking the girl to hang out right away if you just met her, unless she's throwing you over-the-top signs she's interested. You have to build a certain level of trust and rapport before you can hang out w/ her. Next time you should ask for her number or social media instead of asking her to hang out right away. Or, you can combine the two and say ""If you're interested, I'd like to take you to XYZ place sometime, maybe I can grab your number and I'll talk to you later."""
"Thanks. Ill definitely take your advice. Im still new at this and its nice to get some feedback. Now that Im thinking about it, I have noticed that, Im so quick about asking for a hang out without having had the opportunity to build rapport. Next time, on a different girl, Ill try it."
I found the best thing to do is to approach 9-10s.
It's best to approach 11's
"Don't ask a girl out while she's working, please. Sincerely : a girl that got asked out multiple times while working and that had to keep a professional composure while being very uneasy"
"Hi. I know now however I would like to mention that, it wasnt awkward or anything. From now, Ill refrain."
"I know, I'm sure you were really lovely. Just a heads up !"
"I think what the underlying issue is not the person rejecting you, but dealing with the possibility of being rejected a hundred times. That dating show Take Me Out is a key attribute to this, it doesn't matter to the guy what kind of girl rejects him, could be the most beautiful one there that says no and it won't affect him, it's when all the lights go out is when the guy's mentality is affected. Getting rejected by the most stunning and intelligent girl you ever laid eyes on isn't the problem, it's getting rejected over and over and over again is what guys are afraid of."
Youre so right. How have you dealt with it?
"With rejection? Honestly; relief, thinking thank fuck I've done my part, I don't have to question what if anymore and I can go on with my day. It's when I think about the amount of times I've been rejected is when I question if my ego can take anymore, it's the reason I don't bother with the likes of Tinder and Bumble, I get denied enough in real life, what little ego and self esteem I have left will be devoured if I go onto dating sites."

Does not account for attractiveness. Huge portion of women go to a small amount of men
"Statistic always quoted by incel : [https://www.sciencealert.com/the-percentage-of-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-a-record-high](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-percentage-of-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-a-record-high) 28% of 18-29 don't have sex, so it mean 72% have sex. 72% of men is not a small amount of men, it's the majority .

MFA- Any way to see who doesn't have it turned on?We have turned on MFA for our tenant and I want to verify everyone was turned on. Is there no way to see that info in the admin panel or export a CSV? If not does anyone have the powershell command to export a list? Thanks!
You can see it in the mfa authenticator panel. It will show all the users and if they are enabled or not.
"Thank you, I see that but I have about 500 users and that list cannot be exported and you can only see 20 at a time."
But we can store Superman on a piece of glass!!! :-)
"Not from me, but from u/ihaxr $cred = Get-Credential Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred $users = Get-msoluser -All $users | select DisplayName,@{N='Email';E=$\_.UserPrincipalName}},@{N='StrongAuthenticationRequirements';E={($\_.StrongAuthenticationRequirements.State)}} | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation C:\\somecsv.csv"
"> $users = Get-msoluser -All $users | select DisplayName,@{N='Email';E=$_.UserPrincipalName}},@{N='StrongAuthenticationRequirements';E={($_.StrongAuthenticationRequirements.State)}} | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation C:\somecsv.csv I am a bit unfamiliar with Powershell. I have used it several times but it has been a while. It is failing on the 'Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred' step."
Try these steps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/powershell/connect-to-office-365-powershell#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell
"Make sure you monitor it regularly. I've had people turn it off by IT ""temporarily"" that never turned it back on again."
You could set up some conditional access policies to enforce MFA be enabled for your users too.
Conditional access isn't included in the free azure that comes with O365. Good idea though.
"Can you be more specific about your licensing level and what ""turned on"" means? Have you looked at Security defaults? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults"
"Try this script, it's perfect for creating reports on either people who have it enabled or disabled. Even shows mobile numbers or 'reason' (manual or via conditional access policy etc): https://o365reports.com/2019/05/09/export-office-365-users-mfa-status-csv"
"You can have O365 Support walk you through how to do this over a screen share - as long as you're specific in your request. &#x200B; **Make connection to O365** `Connect-MsolService` &#x200B; **MFA Status** `Get-msoluser -All | select UserPrincipalName,@{N='MFA State';E={($_.StrongAuthenticationRequirements.State)}}` &#x200B; **Users who have enrolled in MFA themselves (gone through 2 factor auth w/ phone/device)** `Get-MsolUser -All | where {$_.StrongAuthenticationMethods -ne $null} | Select-Object -Property UserPrincipalName` &#x200B; **\*\*Get a CSV export of the users who have gone through the MFA enrollment process\*\*** `Get-MsolUser -All | where {$_.StrongAuthenticationMethods -ne $null} | Select-Object -Property UserPrincipalName | Export-Csv ""C:\Users\username\Desktop\MFAReport_UsersSelfEnrolled.csv""` &#x200B; **MFA Status exported as a spreadsheet (this is just a copy of what you can already get via in the GUI of the O365 MFA Control Panel)** `Get-msoluser -All | select UserPrincipalName,@{N='MFA State';E={($_.StrongAuthenticationRequirements.State)}} | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation C:\Users\username\Desktop\MFAReport.csv`"

Have you installed the powershell modules for office 365? You may find the connect msol command required different modules to the usual you have installed. 'Install-Module -Name MSOnline' should do the trick I believe.
Every time I have a rock in my shoe I think of this scene... Youve been gravelled!
My username came from this scene
"What happened to you Playdohpants? You used to be cool, now youre just all about the money... :("
"Ok my god, JD's face"
"He's clearly making an ""f"" sound. Doesn't match the text. What else did he say from that scene? Edit: I paused my way through the scene. He's saying ""been"" in this still. I don't know how. I think he's just making an exceptionally awesome face."
how do you make a v sound
That's a pretty hard V. I don't remember it sounding that hard.
The use of lost cause at the end of this episode is great. Its unfortunate they had to use a different song in the streaming versions
"[yup, here it be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BptMopU482o)"
I always wanna gravel my sister but I dont think shed remember this.
Even with her gravel pit?
I love it
I just watched this episode the other day!

Experts Warn Climate Change Could Kill Great Deku Tree Within 12 Years
Archive links for this post: * **Archive:** https://archive.md/RAoJQ ---- I am Mnemosyne reborn. Those who forget history are bound to repeat it. ^^^/r/botsrights
"OK, I get this is supposed to be satire, but if you're going to use a Deku Tree maybe don't use the one that dies in the first 30 minutes of gameplay. Of the three times a Deku Tree has featured, this is on the only appearance that dies. A little research goes a long way."
"Agreed, how could this satire site get facts wrong??"
Read the article before commenting on how well researched it is.
"I did read the article... I really liked the way the waved off *what actually killed the tree* as a conspiracy theory, though."
DaE ClImAtE cHaNgE iS fAkE!? i SaW a SnOwFlAkE!
Dekuuuuuuuu~~~
It's actually 11 years now. We have to hold them to it as a reminder. Every year that passes we need to remind them they said only this much time is left
Climate change is a gamer gate issue how?
Climate change is a scientific fact. Why is this nonsense being shared here?
There is a difference between understanding that climate change happens and the alarmist doomsday predictions that have been spewed across every platform imaginable.
"The science supports many of those ""alarmist"" predictions. This is just embarrassing."
How?
"OH NOES!!!!! We cant let the Great Deku die again. I cant go through that trauma a second time. What do I do? Do I throw money at my computer screen and hope that mini Mike, Ocasin-Cotex and that little Swedish brat does something about it? How am I supposed to sleep tonight knowing that climate change is going to kill this beloved fictional tree? DO SOMETHING, SOMEONE!!!!"
"Girl at my school literally raped a guy, not a single repercussionLong story short it was a school outdoor education trip and one guy (M17 who had a gf) was sleeping in a tent when he woke up to find a different girl (F17) having sex with him in his sleep. He stopped it but no one did anything about it. No expulsion for literal rape, no jail, nothing. The other way round hed have been lucky to survive the beatings from other guys there, let alone avoid expulsion and jail."
"Yep, it's horrible. There are men that believe that too, which is just as sad. Both of these beliefs contribute to a terrible sexual harassment/rape culture."
It's big boy bullshit if you ask me.
I would make police report and bring it to national media level.
Media wouldnt cover this.
"Some will, there are plenty of opposition media outlets that would jump on this. If the leading narrative media doesnt want to report something because it doesnt conform to their standards of what is right/wrong. GO to opposition, even if you dont agree with those people on other things."
Try and convince this guy to file an official report and an official complaint against the school
I havent seen him in over a year and we were never close sadly. It was two years ago too so itd be a bit late to do anything.
Anyone interested in putting together a team to write a comedy show?
"Yeah I was thinking I'd be good at being a comedian. I told my friends that, and they laughed!"
Yeah nahh
DM me with your plan.
Best of luck guys
Thanks. If we need a cameo from a walrus would you know anyone?
"I have no writing experience, nor am I particularly funny... Ill do it."
Perfect. Ill DM you
What kinda comedy we talking?
The good kind that makes you laugh
"Ah, but what is funny to one group is not to another, no?"
For TV? Stage?
That's a good one
Sure sounds like fun - DM me and lets get it happening
"dont push for it. As friends is a bad line, if she wants to spend time with you then she'll either... A. agree and not mention the boyfriend or B. tell you ""sure as friends"" or C. ""I have a boyfriend but we could as friends"" (I would avoid this since you wont get anywhere)"
Did you ask for her social afterwards?
This doesn't look like a success.... Regardless of whether she has a bf or not she is not interested. You should of dropped it and not insist that is creepy. She didn't even wanted to be friends so i don't see the point here. She probably just wanted another Instagram follower and hoped you won't bother her lol.
"Its a success regardless because he tried. People are way too tied into results. Once he does this enough he will get there, its the beginning thats tough. I applaud you good sir keep going dont give up!! One approach a day this is inspiring stuff I am doing this next!!"
"It isnt success if trying is overridden by being creepy. Yes there is an effort but in a bad sense , it is not healthy. It isn't about results you can try normally and fail issue here is insisting that is big no no."
"Asking to have coffee as friends is not unhealthy or insisting. Who knows how she felt about it. Clearly this is a starting point. Its better than not doing anything and sitting around wondering what wouldve happened. Yes this wasnt a good approach to it and I always think connecting with a girl on a human level must come first before asking them out, but baby steps."
Look I am okay with trying cold approach that is good practice nothing wrong with that. However if you turn interactions to this it would not go anywhere and you mess up all the effort you put. You basically can cut it when you supposed to and don't leave other party in stress and don't waste time yourself. Simple as that. This is bad for both parties. Asking a coffee as a friend is just plain lie and both parties know about it. So let's pass that.
What part of it is creepy? He just did 2 questions. How is that insisting dude?
"He asked same questions initiating contact. f girl says she has bf she either told you a lie which you should leave her or she has a bf you should leave her. Then you don't go and ask for a coffee as friends everyone know reality here , then when she says she doesn't even want a coffee as friends you don't get her Instagram. It is just plain creepy and me getting downvoted would not change this fact."
"I don't know who downvoted, but I get where you are coming from. Is kinda pushy, but from the info that OP posted there's no way to say it's creepy. If a girl tells you she has a boyfriend doesn't mean you are prohibited to talk to her, although obviously one should uderstand she is not interested. I don't know OP but if he is starting to put himself outhere this counts as a win, since he haven't (allegedly) been disrespectful. The fact that he has not yet the social skills down, at this stage is irrelevant. (If you are OP reding this, good for you. Just keep in mind your surroundings, and be respectful)"
Yeah I mean trying and such as I said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster. However being pushy just spoils that. It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to. Plus girls care a lot about Instagram followers these days ( lame but true ). Anyway OP try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people's boundaries please.
bro you gotta start taking pictures so we can have better engagement with posts haha just a thought
"""Maybe"" and ""sometime"" needs to be taken out of your vocabulary when talking to women. Let's see how this would sound without these two words: ""Do you want to grab a coffee?"" See how this one sounds more direct and confident? When you say maybe and sometime, it makes you seem uncertain with your self-confidence. Women hate uncertainty. They love spontaneity, but hate uncertainty. Practice leaving these words out of your vocabulary when you ask women out and you'll notice you'll appear more confident, which can lead to better results."

Awww feminists are whining that Harley Quinns movie failed
Literally my thoughts. They already have Harley. Why do they need the Joker too?
"Yeah, you think they would've caught on by now, but oh well"
"Female Joker would be played by Lily Singh the talentless hack a major network gave her own show Hey, shes perfect for it lol"
I wish they would fund more Feminist movies
There are actually tons of these already See the sequel to girl with the dragon Tatoo
"The joker made that all the villains be white males. walk around a major city like detroit, it aint white men in suits you have to be afraid of."
Most ambitious fantasy film in history.
"Yeah, I guess you're right..."
"Actually, the movie flash point has a female joker. so instead of the parents being shot, bruce ends up getting shot. Dad becomes batman, mom becomes joker. She sees not reason for this world without her child, so she wants to burn the shit to the ground. Batdad tries to stop her at every turn. he doesn't use fancy martial arts or intellect, he just shoots the bad guys. I would love to see animated batdad joker mom."
The best advise i can give youFirst look: Coincidence Second look: Curiosity Third look: What are you waiting for to talk to me?
"What about first long sustained look for a few seconds? Also, if you're out walking there's no time for multiple fucking looks. In the end so called IOIs usually don't mean shit."
"Obviously it will depends on the situation... This is an advise , not the solution for all of your problems"
This. I like
For bars clubs Cafe use IOIs. If she looks at you more than a sec means she is very attracted to you.
Gotcha. Eat the women. I will try this. Thanks!
My best advice: Make your life awesome for you. Invite people in Make it awesome for those you like
r/thanksimcured
How would you react if its a coincidence? Surprised? Shrug it off?
Me at a coffee shop today. First 4 looks: coincidence ... Fuck she left I needed this 12 hours ago :/
What do you do if it never goes past the first look
Give her a reason to look & then leave it at that to see if you get that 2nd and 3rd look

"The way he just posed after knocking her out, something tells me that its not his first rodeo"
"Ugly Old Men with High Standards I was looking at the comments on this really hot girl's Instagram. She has a perfect body, beautiful face, and over 40,000 followers. The comments on her photos are filled with desperate 45 year old, fat, balding men. It insults me that they think they have a chance with her. One of them asked her to ""DM him"", and he was literally 40 years old, deformed, fat, balding, AND had photos with his WIFE and KID all over instagram. Wtf man. Why even bother to get married? Another one worked as a trucker, posted boomer memes, and looked like he was missing a chromosome. I can't cope I blame all those dumb rom-coms where fat nerds end up with hot girls"
"Yeah, I hate old men with high standards. Old people shouldnt have the nerve to expect a 10/10 when they have nothing to offer ""visually"". My boss is the same. He is about 50-something I guess and his recent girlfriend was a young, cute woman in her mid 20's, imagine how disgusting it looked when they were walking side by side, holding hands. He legit looked like her father. Just last week she broke up with him (lmao, I knew that relationshit wasnt going to hold on any longer. I always sensed she was after his money or has minor daddy issues) and he was sad about it of course. My coworker also told me that my boss is very picky about women, hence why he's a single old man with two daughters. Worst thing is, one day he randomly told me ""why do you look so good on your CV than in real life?"" LMFAO, the nerve of that old man to say this to me!!! I'm sorry, but I'd be a LIAR if I said I didnt mog this old man to hell and back!! He is not only unattractive, he's also sexist and downright disrespectful!!"
"Agreed! Why do the jerk 'nice-guys' who think they are entitled to 'get the girl' always get paired with the pretty, empowered, and happy-to-be-herself-girl at the end of the movie?? Who is that a happy ending for? NOT THE GIRL!"
"Some old men were attractive back in the day and cant let go of it. When I was 10 I slept over at a friends house - her mother was a 30y old Filipino woman and her father a 70y old white man. Highly doubt they found each other organically and he didnt pluck some young, poor woman from an Asian country but I digress. When I was there, this mans barely talked to me but then suddenly pulled out pictures of when he was young to show to me and have me say he used to look good. No pictures of his daughter, my friend, as a baby or of his two other kids from another marriage I hadnt seen before. No, pictures of him when he was young and such a handsome man."
This is why I don't want to be in a relationship. If someone were to choose me they would do it because they have no options and they would resent me for not looking like those pictures on the internet that he thinks he's entitled to.
"What you said is the sum total of how I feel and no one seems to believe. Men's expectations are sky high, no matter how they look, and after the first blush of newness and gratitude wears off, he'd resent me for his inability to ""pull"" better."
Sometimes when ugly men think they have a chance with me it lowers my self-esteem
you see this on any instagram models page
"I think attention from older men is really endearing. Why is it an insult for someone with experience to be attracted to you? Some older men know what theyre doing, what they want, what they can provide, they have stable incomes and jobs and developed hobbies and interests. This is hugely appealing to me. Someone who might have their crap together being attracted to me makes me feel awesome. Younger men can be volatile, move onto the next hot thing on the internet. Thoughts?"
Where is the guarantee that older men won't move on to the next hot thing ?
Yes lol!!! Or 3rd world stupid idiots that write shit like: someone give me her number?? Wtf dude lol!! We should post screenshots here and laugh about them lol

"You know, I'm actually glad they included allegedly because the trial hasn't happened yet."
"This is a legal requirement as the trial hasn't happened yet. Nothing to do with the genders of the accused or the victim.

"Girl, 11, left at home with her four-year-old sister, secretly filmed herself getting a savage beating from her drunken mother. Suspended sentence."
"What I find ridiculous here, is the fact that having custody of kids is the one thing that again and again keeps mothers out of prison for committing almost any crime. However, here we have a serial child abuser who finally loses custody of her kids, and yet she's spared prison. And once again, it's the supposed impact on kids used as an excuse, despite the fact that they're now in foster care and surely best kept well away from their ""mother""."
But if the genders were reversed it would be a lot worse. Typical
Women can not be sued. Poor child
Anyone else feel that the word mother shouldnt be used in these cases? What a monster.

"CDG 2E to 2F Short LayoverIn June we are flying from JFK to CDG on Air France, then from CDG to ATH on Air France as well (all booked on the same ticket). The outbound flight to ATH leaves an hour after the inbound flight from JFK and our booking page shows we'll need to change terminals. Is that transfer doable in an hour? It seems like it will be really tight. I'm assuming Air France will transfer our luggage, so no need to wait to retrieve it and we can focus on just getting to our gate. However, will we need to go through any inspection sites (passport, customs, etc...) on the way or will we be able to stay airside? And if we miss our flight, I'm assuming Air France will book us the next one out if there is room?"
"prior experience. sfo>cdg>nce disembarking may take some time as we had to wait for gate upon landing. clearing customs was a nightmare at cdg. chaos in the lines and not many people working. took over an hour for customs. this was during december, so ymmv. good luck."
Was this all on the same ticket and airline?
yes. AF all the way through on a single ticket. i do not remember how luggage was handled.
"Your luggage will be transferred directly, so no need to worry about that. As long as your first flight isn't delayed, it is doable. You'll need to catch the monorail from E to F, but they arrive every few minutes so you shouldn't be hanging around too long, then you have to go through security. All in all it takes around 30-40mins."
I think the monorail is only from 2E-M. I transit CDG frequently but only between 2E-L/K and 2F and I've never once taken the monorail (tbh didn't even know there was one). It's not a long walk.
"You are correct, it is only from 2E-M. I travel through CDG a few times a year on my way to the UK from CPT and have only ever used the monorail, so I didn't realise it was walkable from the other halls. Thanks for pointing it to OP as he may only have to walk now."
"CC: u/elijha Thanks for your help. I was expecting just to walk it. And both flights (inbound and outbound) are Air France, if that matters for which terminal/sub-terminal we land in (we know what terminal we leave from)."
"You'll have to go through transfer security, immigration, and then walk a bit. An hour is tight but not impossible (they wouldn't let you book if it it was). In my experience, transfer security at CDG is quite quick, as is immigration. Luggage will be transferred for you and, worst case scenario, you'll be rebooked if you miss it."
"Girls want you to be genuine.. Whatever you are.. Own it. They hate when you are confused of your identity and is not comfortable with yourself and is trying to change yourself. It means you are not proud of yourself.Even if you are a nice guy.. Own it.. Be a nice guy properly. Don't half ass it. Don't hate being a nice guy while being a nice guy. Q - Then why do nice guys do not get girls and they get friend zoned A - Bcoz I think they are not being nice properly.. They dropped niceness the moment they get rejected even a little bit.. If they have carried the niceness a long just by enjoying their niceness, girl will get interested. She don't hate you for being nice. She hate you for acting and thinking yourself as a nice guy when clearly you are not one When you are actually a nice guy, she will never leave you Most guys only pretend though and carry the niceness like a opportunistic mask If you are not proud of yourself and feel like you need improvements, then own this fact. Tell her.. You are not perfect and you are working or want to improve yourself. Right in this confidence of your weaknesses, you impressed her bcoz now she know that the one who can even accept such weaknesses must have some solid soul."
A man should be genuine. For himself. Not because girls don't like it.
"No, men value is based upon how much women wants him. Thats how it is. Who is cooler a guy who cant get any women or a guy who has a haram of women wanting him? Exactly."
"Backwards equation. People who are cool, interesting, and successful usually attract women. Attracting women doesn't make you cool man"
"What? Yes it does. If you attract women then you are by definition cool, unless you are insinuating that losers are able to attract a lot of women?"
Be cool with people in general. Women are just a subset of that group.
"Yes, but, that's not the point of this sub or the post"
"While this is true I think it's because Chad is extremely confident that he get girls. I mean he is handsome big tall with a perfect face and probably impeccable style.

Of course if you are handsome and rich is a little easier ti become confident, but still"
"Steering this back to OPs point, I think its easier to be confident when youre genuine. Even the best liars deep down are afraid to be found out. But yes, it all comes down to confidence."
"Nope. I know what OP is trying to say, but it's said poorly. The point is to be congruent. Best is to congruently be alpha as fuck. If you can't pull off being a badass with congruence... Then next best is to be as close to alpha as you can, while maintaining congruence. Worst of all is congruently being a ""niceguy"" beta. That said, I'd like to see some good examples of different styles of game. Most coaches I've seen have a very similar style. It's a laid back, witty, sexual vibe... That, while alpha, is hard for beginners to pull off congruently. I'd actually really like to see a progression from niceguy to alpha in stages."
And what if a guy is someone who wants to stay in his house all day and look at a screen?
"Lol, ""be yourself""."
Sensory Learning Process...WHAT?!?!
"Snapshots: 1. Sensory Learning Process...WHAT?!?! - [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/20200309160417/https://i.redd.it/ko4wfg677ol41.png), [archive.today](https://archive.today/loadin) *I am just a simple bot, **not** a moderator of this subreddit* | [*bot subreddit*](/r/SnapshillBot) | [*contact the maintainers*](/message/compose?to=\/r\/SnapshillBot)"
"To be gross, my ""sensory learning process"" has taught me when diarrhea is coming on, but knowing doesn't mean a whole damn lot."
This is so bizarre
"Wha....how...where...??? While I do believe there is a link between tampons and some womens flow (I have no evidence to back this up, just anecdotes from many women) - how was she then handling her period? Its not like you can hold it. Did she just free bleed into underwear she didnt care about? I dont get it!"
"Obviously she is a period jedi, but in all seriousness there is no way not to use anything and not make a mess."
"Assuming that this is true (big mulligan), would it even be smart? Knowing a flow is coming doesn't help much if you can't quickly run to the bathroom to wait it out. Unlike feeling a huge shit coming, you can't hold in your period."
"I thought they meant earlier sign like cramps the day before instead of ""Omg I'm getting my period right now!"" signs. Still call bs on it"
"Well shit, I dont know what Ive been doing wrong my whole life. I can count on my fingers the number of times Ive even use tampons, but my periods without birth control lasted 9-11 days, heavy flow, and lots of cramping. Yay endometriosis! Im on pops BC now and havent had a period for over a year. Eff that noise."
"Tampons make me cramp and I know a lot of my friends feel that way too. But.... does she run to the bathroom every time she ""senses"" her flow? I recommend both the cup and the washable pads. I spent maybe $50 4 years ago on everything. And they are not like those articles that make them out to be a disgusting hassle."
Love my cup! I just got a disc style one and love it even more. Not a hassle at all
"I can't always have something inside due to a defensive pelvic floor but I love mine when it is cooperative. But the pads are the softest things ever. They don't feel any bulkier than disposable pads either, and way more comfortable. And no risk of getting it glued to a pube or sensitive skin either."
"'My life is so much simpler since I learned I could just spend several days hovering close to a toilet at all times, naked from the waist down. It's so much easier than using sanitary products!'"
Seriously though! I'd imagine it's quite like being sick and needing to vomit. Except there is no convenient bucket to puke in. You just live near a bathroom for a few days. That totally shouldn't effect anything.
this is some serious woo
"People who are witnessing Corona Virus cases in Pakistan, from which city you are and how bad is the situation?"

Woman steals money from Uber Driver and gets no jail time whatsoever
I hope all the uber driver's see this and she can't get a ride to save her life.
She even stares at the camera while she takes it. What a dumbass.

Dont steal and life is easy
How do you know she didn't get any jail time?

[deleted]
Kaitlin Bennet is this right wing nut who goes on college campuses and does her best to provoke people. Recently shes been getting a lot of flak online for being a jerk but what these tweets are pointing out it is that the right doesnt even seem to care about her
"Reminds me of the meme a while back which compared the looks of right wing vs. left wing women. RW men like Limbaugh and tRump love to openly bash ugly women, even if they look like balding potbellied toads themselves."
"This isn't surprising at all, males only want hot girls in their camp, cumbrains have no real principles at the end of the day when it comes to women. If you're not fuckable, your trash, doesn't matter if you're willing to work to spread their ideology, they don't want you in their club. Males view women as wastes of space unless they're attractive, you can share all their views, doesn't matter. If she was hot she could have killed people and have a career. All this mockery of her is just people justifying their sadism against women they view as unattractive at the end of the day. She's not up to their standards, so she's a punching bag, and her trying to fit in with them just makes it all the more satisfying for them to attack her like the gross shallow apes they are."
Literally me. I'm a centrist-focused liberal (yes I made that up and you're gonna live with that) and this is one thing I hate about the right. Sometimes I feel like damn why do I even like RP in the little ways I do when I can share the same views with their men and them still not give a fuck about me because I'm ugly
"I disagree with her politics, but (controversial) I find her pretty in a wholesome, girl-next-door way. How on earth is she unattractive? I understand she is engaged, too."
"How does the OP make her living? Posting on Instagram? ""Ha ha, you're ugly and poor! I don't like your politics so you deserve it! I'm a feminist but I gloat about being pretty and pose carefully for photos to get attention. No contradictions there!"""
"It's honestly ironic, since the girl who made the tweet claims to be a FeMIniST and attacks another girl's appearance. Also, the girl who made the tweet looks like a femcel tbh and seems insecure about her own appearance. She is uglier than the gun girl"
"I looked at her Twitter... she has a livestream, which she announces not with an image related to the serious subject at hand, but of a makeup-enhanced selfie of her looking at herself smugly. The Tweet above is clearly DRIPPING with projection. Kids these days are turds, especially the pretty girls. The Internet is the end of civilization."
She wants a job at the Young Turks SO BAD she can almost taste the professionally-applied lipstick.
I used to follow every feminist i was recommended to until they eventually say something lookist or fatphobic. I'm still a feminist but i one must be careful and edit on who we follow bc some of these women are still shedding toxicity while having a large following of fiery young ladies who think replying with an avatar of someone unattractive that they disagree with is an how they get points in an argument.
"I'm confused by this post. For starters - Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot""? She's an attractive skinny white blond woman who spends her internet time trying to get people to shit on shooting survivors. I guess ""hot"" means looking like idiot mean girl Tomi Lahren? All of these people style themselves based on high school mean girls and Ann Coulter. They're all minions of disgusting right wing mouth breathers who secretly wish we lived in ""Handmaid's Tale"" Gilead, rape was legal, and it would probably be legal to murder ugly women or women and little girls who protested rape with impunity. She **does** deserve it. No offense OP - but the woman you're posting is right on target, if what she's saying is true. Fuck Kaitlin Bennett. I enjoy when misogynistic women reap what they sow. You think they're allies? They're not. They're not worth spilling tears for either. And I'm saying this as someone that finds the left as creepy, looksist, and secretly often as misogynistic as the right, so long the selected target is white (maybe Asian), cisgender - shit, even a lot of their attacks on men frequently strike me as fucked up and underwritten by ulterior motives totally divorced from any real, sustainable concept of justice, logic, or interpersonal accountability. Caitlin Jenner - who spent her pre-transition life as a right-wing jock with no interest in problems for women or sexual minorities and apparently has the same politics now, theoretically at her own detriment (but not literally of course - she's rich) - being lauded as a heroine is proof of that, frankly. I'm just sort of at a loss as to how Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot"" but I don't give a shit if misogynistic women reap what they sow. Fuck right, they deserve it. They're agents of the men who want to put their favorite hookers in cabinet positions (Berlusconi), make rape legal, illegalize any medication or health procedure women need to participate in society as equals/control their own reproduction, and create a right wing theocracy. No sympathy. Also - whoever this LivPosting is, she's not actually a hot chick or any ""hotter"" than Bennett; she strikes me as an average looking woman calling out a blond bimbo wannabe for supporting an ideology that leaves ""not hot"" chicks out in the cold, so...I dunno, what is the point of this post again? This woman isn't justifying looksism, she's pointing out the consequences of hypocrisy and being felled when you charge for misogyny and misogynistic ideology while female. Do you not see that? Are you offended because of your politics (in which case, I guess I should apologize for speaking so frankly) and the apparent anti-woman mindset of this Liv Posting? Are you really caping for hateful anti-feminists like Kaitlin Bennett, who are even less sympathetic to femcels and ugly women than even shitty corporate ""liberal"" feminists who are as focused on virtue signalling for a paycheck as anything else (like our wonderful friends at Mel Magazine, who have such contempt for the women here they'd lift their posts without asking) and have no empathy for real women if they have a self-serving goal in mind? The whole point of these posts is that Kaitlin Bennett supports a misogynistic society where looksism and sexism used against women is embraced. She's a (horrible, hateful, stupid, famewhore) woman without a country. I'm sorry if you're conservative and that's why you're irked here. Right and left - be it vocal, performative antifeminism voiced by babes of Fox primetime, Tomi Lahren, Meghan McCain, and Bennett; or highly visible corporatized ""feminist"" values presented by shitty faux-""woke"" startups that are revealed to treat their employees like garbage/shitty ""content"" spewing blogs like Mel, at al are mostly predicated on two things, two gods they worship in kind - self-serving engagement numbers, and money. So they support quashing labor laws and fair wages and fair medical leave and HRs that actually treat sexual harassment seriously and, in Bennett's case, try to jumpstart a career by inciting people to wish murder on high schoolers that watched their friends die, wearing AKs as accessories. On top of whatever right wing woman-hating horseshit she's promoting while hustling for a speaking engagement on the neocon airwaves. Those antifeminists are the ultimate pickmes and only support feminism (for themselves, primarily, and perhaps women exactly like them) to justify...anti-feminism. To justify pushing the overturning of Roe v Wade. To justify ""my choice is a feminist choice because I have a vagina! (There's no such thing as marital rape! Let's murder gay people and burn witches again! Rah rah rah! Let me show you my tits!)""-style feminism, from their seats of influence, their soap boxes and promotional events. They're all united with one idea in mind - so long as I get mine (get my abortion, my featured piece, my seed funding, can roast other women alive for deserving to be harassed/raped, can use a shitty hashtag phonily presenting any incident where a woman is victimized, polarizing men and woman in the aftermath or something like a high profile revelation of a sex crime) - fuck everyone else. Fuck facts. I want the spotlight. A pox on all of them. I wish the two camps would cannibalize each other."
What would happen if they switched roles and a man came up to a woman in that matter ?
Props to the guy for being so calm. Some people really need to get off the drugs and do something better with their lives.
"It may have been schizophrenia because she was so paranoid about what people were ""saying"" like she thought people were following her and stuff"
Wait this subreddit is posting about a schizophrenic woman as if she has some sort of privilege?
"Hey doc, how did you diagnosed her? All I see is a woman that harassed that dude, then went on to harass some little company in the back. By the way, doc, even if she is a schizophrenic, last time I checked, no one gets to harass people, regardless of their mental health. But that young lady seems to be getting a pass here."
"Are you ok? You seem really to need to have your pussy pass be the reason.. (pussy pass= whining 99 times out of a 100 BTW) So you think its more likely that she feels like she can act strange by virtue of having a vagina? Ok ... you can think that , the internet is fun right?"
If it was a guy that would have proceeded very differently. Fits the theme of the subreddit. No reason for hostilities.
"You havent seen people be annoyed by an insane man before? We live different lives I guess. I see people talking to birds and ghosts every day. Mostly people just pretend they dont see them or take it in stride. It seems a stretch to try and make this anthill into a mountain IMO, but like I said you do you. She seems pretty nuts and Im guessing she needs mental health help."
"Im am very well! How about you? How shitty your life is, rank it from 1 to 10?"
Im having a fun time laughing at some of these subreddit communities. Its childish but fun.
Good for you
You know that lady is probably mentally diseased right?
"Why is that even matter? Do you think people with mental illness are allowed to do anything they want? What point are you trying to make here? Besides, I think she is just being an idiot, or maybe shes under influence, and cant control her idiotic impulses. But it doesnt change the fact either."
You have issues man.
"Oh, fuck off..."
"Security - Open WIFI NetworkJust noticed that 2 of my 4 speakers are showing up as ""open"" WiFi networks while my HP Printer and modem show as ""secured"". Additionally, I was able to connect to these ""open"" networks with my iPhone. Sounds like trouble. How do I make these ""secure"" connections? All 4 are Vizio Crave 360. Model SP50-05. I connect thru a Verizon router, Actiontec model Mi242WR rev I. I use the Vizio Smartcast app to setup my speakers and Google Home to group"

Thanks mark
But that's exactly how it is interpreted to be celebrated by feminists. Radical feminists would like to see this every day
And you're posting yet another anti-feminism post on a Men's Rights forum. Is this irony?
How is this anti-feminist? Could you explain?

Imagine if this was a man
IIRC she didnt kill him. It was a bad wound but the guy recovered from it. They are both doing escort kinda job and both pretty douchey tbh(the guy later advertised himself using this incident lol). Thing went viral on the internet pretty much because the girl looks prettier than celebrities. Absurd.
"why am i not surprised at some point the same thing will happen with a stunning young mother who ate her newborn baby because she's a ""real life vore mother"""
fucking weebs
This sums this up perfectly
"Happens more with men, just look at Ted Bundy"
"True. There are entire communities that idolize criminals, whatever gender they were."
What freaks me out are the communities on Tumblr that worship the Columbine school shooters and fantasize about being in relationships with them. Talk about skeezy
"Male killers get fan mail by the pound. I think this is just a thing where if hundreds of millions of people hear a story, a couple thousand will be crazy."

"That wasnt a percent, but by percent of total it was optimistic"
Not really r/pussypass there are a lot of people who believe that the school shooters are hot and a lot believe that ted Bundy shouldnt be in jail and fantasize about him. There was even some people who blamed the girl who got away from him and hate her. Human race is a fucked up species
Yeah more /r/cringe
"Look, us weebs have done a lot of stupid shit. But when this story came to light, even I had to draw the fucking line."

Ask the Pros: Worst Roster Change | Six Invitational 2020 | SiegeGG
"The Gotcha move is and was the worst for sure. O and Liquid with -bullet +gohan, I believe they droped Bullet for him, was a bad one aswell"
Nope the -pino +gohan was the worst
"O yea, I totaly forgot about that"
"It wasn't, really. Not in hindsight, at least. It clearly got pino reevaluating his situation and he came back twice the player."
"Pino never really put up bad numbers though, he was in the middle of the team and was chilling. When I saw the move I was like wtf pino has been doing good, but like you said he is doing better now"
But it didn't even affect them. They still came out number 1.

Crazy how different R6 esports would be if the rumored -Laxing +Bosco had actually happened
- NR losing Wokka and Ramu was the worst IMO. (I know they were separate). NR have some insane players but they just havent looked the same since.
i wouldn't say that they are the worst because: 1.wokka doesn't really count here since he retired and that's an entirely different thing 2. nR was already doing pretty bad when they dropped Ramu and haven't been that much worse since that
Surprised no one said Canadian leaving eg for eg really seemed like the start of egs down fall.
-Goga +Cryn was criticized from day 1 and in hindsight that criticism was correct.
"From recent changes I'd say -Geo +Gotcha and -Goga +Cryn were quite bad, whether they were the worst overall idk, they were the worst in the last 6 months for sure."
goga had shit aim at his last days. Yes he si si plants but atleast have some aim.
Alt Art CardsI have created some alt art cards and am looking for suggestions of where to get them printed. I am based in the U.K. Many thanks
www.makeplayingcards.com
I've used these guys a few times from the UK. Never been disappointed.
Yubb.. I use them for all my printed cards. Only time I've been disappointed is when I ordered a test of plastic cards. And then I was just disappointed on how thin they were. Not their product quality (was checking out if they did a creditcard thickness which they dont).
"[makeplayingcards.com](https://makeplayingcards.com). Just make sure the words ""Star Wars"" are nowhere on the cards. I printed custom made QB cards there, but they rejected them at first. Their communication wasn't clear, so I thought at first that the problem was the Star Wars theme, but after clarification it was only the words ""Star Wars"" I had on the back (as part of the X-wing logo) was the problem. They didn't mind all the images of X-wings, TIEs, and names like Luke and Vader."

Felony in Florida even if you have a permit to carry.
No doubt what the hell right? LOL
I used to do that with Bebe guns before camera phones were out!
That sounds incredibly stupid. Only thing worse then pulling a weapon you aren't willing to use is pulling a replica gun or bb gun that others will think is real.
And I bet you would be the person who would try to sue the guy who had a carry permit and shot your ass when you pulled it on him.

When will AppleCard start reporting to credit bureaus?
Dec-19
"Oh so they do report to them as of December? I have yet to see any changes on my credit report regarding apple card. It shows up as a hard inquiry. But doesn't show up at all in my credit card usage, opened cards, or even payment history. I've had the card for months"
They only report to Transunion right now.
The search box yearns for attention. Use it.
Every time some asks on this sub they move it back 10 months.
So the answer is sometime in the 24th century when money has been abolished.
They've been reporting it to credit bureaus.
They only report to Transuinon. If you have $0 statement balances then dont report anything.
A quick blind Weller 107/SR taste
"Ive never had SR before (somehow harder to find than 107 in my area), so I wanted to taste them blind. Havent had 107 in a few months, so I thought my recollection of it would be hazy. I immediately knew the first glass I was given was SR, despite never trying it. The dead giveaway? Lack of the classic 107 oily mouthfeel. Never realized that was my favorite feature in the 107. Sometimes I think 107 is a little too sweet (wheat gang rise up), but its gotta be one of my all-time favorites. For half the cost ($25 vs $55), SR is unbelievably solid, and a little less sweet than 107. Cant think of anything better for that price point. Opinions?"
"SR is so good for the price. If you dont mind me asking, what is your area where you can get 107 for $55? Im lucky to find it for $100."
Knoxville! Thats the standard price I see around here when its available.
"Nice! Im glad youre not getting ripped off as much as I am. I live in Atlanta. 107 or 12 year, these assholes around here charge you a kidney for it. Last found 107 for $100 in SC. I love special reserve though. I always try to keep a few bottles of that. Cheers!"
I've seen bottles of the 107 and 12 for $250 and $300
"I feel your pain brother as im in ATL as well, but there are a few places in the state that sell at retail"
Same in Ohio. $49.99 plus tax ends up being about $54
""" Cant think of anything better for that price point. "" &#x200B; Regular BT Elijah Craig WT101 Just about any BiB &#x200B; There's quite a few out there."
"I like some of the things you listed, but still think the Wellers mop the floor with them overall. I get it's cool to trash Wellers around here but I don't know any bourbon drinkers that would actually take WT101 over WSR, and to me they are so far apart it's not even worth a conversation."
I think they are both great and sr is my normal wheater when I can get it. 107 is better imo but harder to find.
I find special reserve to be pretty mediocre and would take ogd114 for a few bucks less. Its good for cocktails but def not neat
"Agree. Weller sr is borderline undrinkable for me, only buy it when I see it to give to my tater friends"
I don't know if I'd call it mediocre. it's probably the best wheater under 30 dollars. at msrp it's a great bottle for the value OGD 114 tastes nothing like it. I love ogd for cocktails but not for sipping
"Very mediocre. If it didnt have the weller name no one would buy it. Ogd 114 is high rye, so completely different, but price alone is far better"
Can .local and .config be public? (GitHub backup)I want to back up my settings to a public git repo. I know where my ssh keys are stored and excluded those. Is there sensitive info in `.config` or `.local` that I should be wary of excluding?
"Yes, they can be public. Should they be? Probably not. There's a very high chance that some application will store some sensitive or personal info in there. Unless you're willing to search every file yourself, you probably shouldn't make them public."
Gotcha. Thank you
Why don't you backup to a *private* git repo?
To share? (Within reason?)
Isn't it extremely sexist and paranoid to consider all men to be violent towards women and compare them to guns?

>Isn't it extremely sexist Yes.. but it's sexism against men.. that's allowed by Reddit

I find that incredibly offensive as a man and a gun owner. Every single underlying assumption of her statement is completely incorrect.

[Industry] Star Wars: The Last Jedi Director Rian Johnson Admits He Didnt Care About Star Wars Canon And History
I mean I already knew that given that Colin quit over your dumbass movie and JJ spent half of RoS attempting to retcon it out of existence.
"I mean, obviously..."
That was clear with how garbage the movie was.
Youd be shocked at how many people defended TLJ. I knew it was nothing but irreparable damage to the Star Wars brand when I first saw it and didnt know what to think of it.
"I hated that movie with a passion. I don't know why Rian did that either, cause he's pretty talented, like knives out was pretty good."
"I think it's because he partially doesn't like Star Wars and because he's never done anything except writing singular movies. As far as I know, he's never written or directed a trilogy or two movies set in the same world."
"I've always thought this guy seemed like a prick. Anyway, I have no clue how Disney, etc. could so thoroughly fuck up a gold mine like Star Wars. There's so many things they could have done, instead they just rehashed the original movies while completely negating their accomplishments. Oh well, it's all just a big distraction anyway."
Simple: Lucas trusted Kathleen Kennedy and it turned out she was just a snake who wanted to use his platform for politics an Disney just went with it
"It shows, in the fact that Last Jedi exhibited naked contempt for the OT while discarding the plot hooks from TFA and leaving none for RoS, severing both ends of its own story. It was like a masterclass of the absolute worst, comically insane mistakes a sequel can make, particularly the middle film of a sequel trilogy."
"Remember those assignments in school where your teacher would give you a picture and you'd be asked to write a short story about it within the time limit (Canadian here, these were part of our provincial exams)? If you deviated from the details in the picture or just said ""I don't give a fuck"" and wrote whatever you wanted, you'd fail the assignment full stop. Hell your parents might get called in if you do it consistently and you'd be sat down with school admins and they'd think you have ADD or a learning disability or something. This man failed this simple grade school assignment, *as a fully grown adult in charge of a hundred million dollar franchise.*"
"Imagine being handed machine that prints money. It has a manual and a horde of people that know how to keep it running with just basic care indefinitely. Imagine being the type of person that throws the manual out, tells everyone that knows how to keep it running to shut up, and takes a sledgehammer to the machine thinking you can improve it."
Shocking. Mind blowing. Truly.
"There is a real, general problem in Hollywood right not with a combination of creators who want to make up their own stories, and studios who won't greenlight anything...at least not anything too expensive...that's not part of an existing franchise. So you've got people writing in those pre-existing universes who don't care about them, don't even like them, they want to tell THEIR story but they have to keep a veneer of the franchise over it."
No shit.
"Abuse is abuse, regardless of who's the one doing the abusing"
As a feminist I wish more people were speaking about this. Like seriously.
"Whats with the science-jargon Im seeing in posts lately? And why are so many posters writing paragraphs and paragraphs, of which so little is good practical advice? If I had more time I wouldve written a shorter letter - Mark Twain"
When I see a post get too wordy. Hard next. Less is more. Say a lot with very little.
I have a similar friend in a similar situation right now. It is tough to watch that's for sure.
"Weak men make women the centre of their life, then reflexively fall apart when she inevitably pushes them away. Your friend was a great guy who espoused some red pill truths naturally but in the end was really a beta."
Maybe dont mention to him in bold that thoughts of suicide are the ultimate form of weakness. Because that thought is fucking retarded
You cant show someone the pill. They gotta discover it for themselves.
Have you considered telling your friend's wife and her friends how you feel about the way she has treated your friend?
"Lightswitch effect: https://trp.red/x/q6olwm Also, point him to Rational Male and the Sidebar. >He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Seen this a few times, did that myself until I found TRP (except the marriage part). Guy who's popular and good with girls assumes that this means he's alpha and/or RP thus immune to classic ""post marriage zero sex"" or assumes he can do no wrong and goes full BP. IOW just b/c you can fuck girls doesn't mean you're RP and can't go BP. You're RP if you understand RP."
Keep him busy doing physical shit at least once a day. Seriously
Keeping busy is highly underated
This is your time to help now. Your friend helped you when you were there and now its your turn. He never had the luxury of learning these theories. You did. The universe has placed this in front of you for you to intervene and make this right for your friend.
Most Red Pill suckas in here dont have a spiritual nature to them. Let alone being aware of Jungian psychology and how powerful it is if you ever wanna become an Alpha.
"The sidebar here would be helpful to him. I can relate to this some. Before there was TRP, many men were like your friend. They did RP things naturally without realizing it. But they also had to learn other RP things the hard way. Some learned, others (most) never really figured things out. I was in the former category. If I wasn't sure how to handle something, I'd either be aloof or rude and found that that typically got the results I wanted.

"Interested in an iCloud Keychain Chrome extension?Hi all, I use Chrome on macOS and Safari on iOS. One thing thats annoying is password management, some of my passwords are synced by Chrome, other by iCloud keychain. I made a Chrome extension that gets your password from iCloud keychain in Chrome, that way all your passwords can live in iCloud. Im wondering if anyone else would find this useful, that way Id consider packaging it and putting it on the Chrome Web Store."
"Personally, I use Bitwarden, which has multiple browser plugins, and is O/S agnostic. But, barring that, having everything go to your iCloud Keychain (obviously only iOS or macOS) would be better than multiple password lists."
YES
Will a USB partition work?Will it be able to work if I divide my usb into two sections and have tails on one half and regular storage in the other?
"No. If you want storage on the drive, create Tails through the normal method, and then create a persistent volume."
"Actually, so long as you do your Tails creation first, then if you want it your persistence volume, Tails doesnt care if you partition any remaining free space."
I stand happily corrected. Thanks!
No worries.
"Yes I have done this with mine. I have 3 partitions- one with Tails, one with standard storage, and one as a Veracrypt encrypted partition which I use like persistent storage. You do have to do it in a certain order for it to work, which Im afraid I can remember now, but its certainly possible and works great"
"Always do Tails ***FIRST***, then you can partition the remaining space as you wish."
Thats the one. I tried it a few ways first but there is indeed a correct order to do it
"If you don't want Tails to create persistent volume that takes all remaining space first install Tails, resize it if you need. Next create second partition and leave some free space at the end of disk and then create persistent volume for encrypted data. I once created 4 partitions on one USB stick. Tails, Linux Mint, Hiren's BootCD PE (but only UEFI version will work because of the GPT partition table style) and persistent volume at the end of drive."

"He'll probably end up in foster care. Which can be better, but I've also heard of it being much worse."
I know foster care can be tough but it's better than being literally abandoned.
I agree.

Not overlooking the fact that I'm no chad and I met my fiance on Tinder a few years ago.
"Yeah, I call bullshit on the analysis of Tinder. One of my closest friends talked with me about his inceldom and his plans to kill himself within the next 4 years. He got Tinder and he kept telling me had had no success. But one day he got a match, met up, and lost his virginity. Now hes got all the confidence in the world and hes doing so much better. This guy is *not* a Chad. I promise you that girls on Tinder arent looking for Chad, lol."
I like how they think being nice includes calling someone on their being raped. I hope this specific incel lives a long long life as an incel.

"Do as I say, not as I do."
Talk about YouTube proving the profs point.
"That's odd. The professors argument goes against my understanding of ""fair use"". Great, I hope I can follow up on this later and learn something. The way I've understood it thus far, it is ""fair use"" to use a piece of copyrighted material if you are providing critique, commentary, education, satire, etc *on that material.* Providing commentary on copyright law in general is not commentary on that piece of music. Of course, there is no market usurpation, and I'm sure a minimal clip was used, though that might not be enough of a defense. The nature of the work is clearly a for-profit music arrangement in an artful and novel expression. In effect, nobody is claiming this *isn't* copyright infringement, but is it really *fair use?* It'll be fascinating to see where this goes and what effects, if any, it will have on automated copyright strikes, because automatic systems probably can't do the research required to make a good faith judgement as required by the DMCA. What a mess this could become. I hope it gets lots of press coverage."
"I'm currently working my way through a video by Hoeg Law (actual lawyer, I believe), but I think he's said (and I may be misinterpreting his explanation) that as long as it's used for educational purposes, not just for the material in question but in relation with an example, fair use can be applied. From what I've listened to so far, it seems as though short clips were played to highlight an example of what would be Fair Use and what wouldn't. And that makes sense, you can't sufficientw highlight examples without at least a few short clips of the music in question, and would fall under Fair Use. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF2GMxChNkA"
"If he used a sample short it could be considered fair use as it is being used as an example of what can be used under copyright, therefore making the usage fair use as it is part of the education and therefore is transformative."
Going after lawyers seems like a dumb idea.
Especially a law professor from a tier 1 university.

Identify Host operating system when logged in using Global ProtectIm looking to see if it's possible to have the palo recognise win7 devices that are using the global protect client to connect remotely. I'm wondering if this is would be done using HIPS and a reg key?
Thats already possible but requires a license to use HIPs.
"It's HIP to be Square!! I'm sorry, I had to"
We see the OS used to connect to GP in the logs.
Guidance on where in the logs to look? Is this hips data logging??
"sure thing, under the monitor tab, click on ""system"" logs. use the filter below: **( subtype eq globalprotect) and ( description contains 'GlobalProtect gateway user login succeeded')** from there you will see which user authenticated to the VPN and their OS client used. for example: *( description contains 'GlobalProtect gateway user login succeeded. Login from: <IP Address>, Source region: US, User name: <username>, Client OS version: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro , 64-bit.' )*"
"Go to System logs and run the query subtype eq globalprotect and description contains Windows 7 That should show all Win7 machines connecting. If you have a Syslog server you could generate alerts from there, which is how I do it. Edit: Typo"
This also becomes easier in PAN-OS 9.1 as Client OS Version is a column in the newly introduced GlobalProtect log.

"Withdrawing A Guilty Plea Before Sentencing?Please excuse if this question has been answered before. I am new to reddit and don't have much time to help my friend who I believe has been pressured into pleading guilty to a crime he does not believe himself guilty of. I will refer to him as David here, however this of course is not his real name and I will not provide any identifying details even if asked. David is considering trying to withdraw his guilty plea, for the following reasons: What happened: 1. Five minutes before his plea was due, whilst at the court, he was told the prosecution had completely rewritten the description of the charges against him, to which he claims to be innocent of and has much proof of. 2. He was told by his solicitor he 'will' be found guilty of the new charge by a jury because they will all hate him and ignore his evidence. 3. He was told he will not get 1/3 off his sentence if he does not admit his guilt right there and then. He was told it would be expensive to defend himself and that pleading guilty will save everyone a lot of money. 4. He argued with his solicitor that it did not feel right but minutes later they were called to the court room. 5. As he walked to the courtroom with his solicitor he was told again he should say guilty when asked. 6. Just before he was asked to plea the judge offered an adjournment of a few days to allow defence to consider the rewritten charge, however his solicitor declined the offer without consulting my friend at all. 7. During the plea itself the defence solicitor mouthed plead guilty multiple times at my friend as he hesitated. 8. The rewritten charge arbitrarily changed the period of the offence from a couple of months, to a whole year and included additional un-provable claims not stated before. 9. Later he was told that he could put in a basis of plea setting out his version of events and disputing certain accusations that form the charge. The basis of plea was then submitted but the CPS is saying they will not accept it because it was not agreed at the time of the plea hearing. In addition to the above, David is suffering from chronic depression, officially homeless, often suicidal and very, very vulnerable at this time. As a result, he is very easily influenced and due to the nature of the charges, finds if very hard to argue his innocence without people saying he sounds more guilty by doing so, or he is minimising the offence. IANAL but from my understanding of both the evidence and his explanations. I do not believe him guilty of this crime, although I admit I may be biased and it is a complicated case. He is in a really terrible place at the moment and I want to help him as best I can before what I believe is a miscarriage of justice occurs. Please could someone advise how he might go about asking to withdraw his plea, if this is even possible given the circumstances. His own solicitor has threatened to resign from the case if my friend tries to change his plea now, leaving him undefended with very little time to act before his sentencing."

"Yes, it is possible, but an application must be made to the judge who will decide whether to allow it or not. You must apply in writing and serve it on the prosecutor and the court and as part of your application (unless the court directs): * explain why it would be unjust for the guilty plea to remain unchanged; and * indicate what, if any, evidence the applicant wishes to call; and * identify any proposed witness; and * indicate whether legal professional privilege is waived, specifying any material name and date. Suffice to say, you need professional representation for this - and even then you might be on a hiding to nothing given you were in fact represented. Guess you need to fire your solicitor and get a new one, just in time for sentencing."
He can try and withdraw his plea under [CPR39.3](http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/criminal/docs/2012/crim-proc-rules-2013-part-39.pdf) but he would need to speak to the court ASAP as it would clearly then need to go to trial. I would suggest that he speaks to a new solicitor ASAP if this is what he wishes to do.

You right. It's a good film
"Just SmileSmiling makes all the difference. Smiling shows you were happy before you met her. Smiling gives her the idea that you are living your own life, you seem to be having fun doing it, and maybe she would like to be a part of the fun. Girls want to feel alive and guys with a scowl on their face will likely never even be given the opportunity to talk to her to begin with. No one wants to be around someone that looks bored to death. Sometimes we may come across as serious or intense by getting caught up in our own thoughts by thinking of what to say next, or overanalyzing a past approach. Being caught up in our own thoughts keeps us from living in the moment and enjoying the things around us RIGHT NOW. You dont need to be happy to smile, but you need to smile to be happy. Next time you make eye contact with a girl, dont think, just smile. It will make all the difference."
M. no n
There are a million different ways to smile. Some of which are much much more attractive than others. Google it.
\* Only works if she's attracted to you.
"What if you hate your smile, but think that you appear much cuter with a sad type of face?"
Want to use this but I feel uncomfortable when doing it to a girl. It seems ungenuine...

"Looksmaxxing latelySo, as of late I've been wearing quite a lot of makeup, but I've learned to do it to suite my face. God some more flattering clothes and shoes to add height, got a haircut, etc. Ngl, I still feel ugly asf. Like a pig with makeup on. I really suggest going to skincareaddiction because it made my skin a lot better though. But anyways, I was at walmart the other day grabbing an energy drink. A fairly nice looking young man ( out of my league ) came up to me and said something like ""the real energy drinks are over there"" and smiled at me. The first time a male hasn't looked at me like I'm a garden gnome. Is this ascension girlies? Have I broken free out of my flesh prison or am I just tripping."
"""Yup, if a man, any man (even the nicest looking old man) helps you out without you asking for it, it's because he finds you at least somewhat pretty."" I don't believe this to be a logical, rational comment -- you word it as if it's an absolute fact. &#x200B; I am not attractive conventionally and yet men will pick up things I drop, hold open doors for me, help me slide my stuff to the cashier when my hands are full...and sometimes even make conversation. &#x200B; Maybe some of them do find me appealing physically but some people are actually just nice and have a naturally gregarious personality."
"GOOD QUESTION. As a fellow looksmaxxer, I'm wondering about the same thing. Ive experienced a slight change in behavior too.

"Hostels getting an older crowd?Wondering if anyone else has noticed more and more older folk at hostels? I ask, as I am currently sitting at a semi party hostel where the entire crowd in the kitchen right now is over 40. So strange. Maybe its the time of year? Some older people Ive met on this trip have been super friendly and open to conversation but feels like most are not like that. Sad as hostels, to me, feel like a place to meet friends and swap stories."
Solo travel is booming and the demographic which has experienced the strongest increases is older women/women in mid age I think.
As is budget traveling. I have met many middle aged/senior travelers who are experiencing so many new places and doing it on a shoestring budget.
"> Maybe its the time of year? That's probably part of it. During the semester, college students tend to be in class, not traveling in another country."
"Is it price? You find young people at the cheaper hostels where they can still tolerate 10+ people dorms and sharing only one shower. When we evolve past shoestring budget and can spare a few more dollars for <4 person dorms and an outlet for everyone, the crowd gets older too because their budget isn't as narrow as the younger counterparts. You have two options, simply switch hostels if you don't like your experience or just deal with it until you move on. You'll definitely have great travel interactions at some point but it's normal that they're not occuring 100% of the time. That's why they're special moments."
Yep.. 48 year old (mostly) solo traveler here. I don't stay at hostels all the time but when I do I'll pick the <6 bed rooms. I've gotten lucky at a few where I was the only one in the room.
"Maybe, hostel is on the cheaper side. Ive met a few really cool older people but on average the older the person has been, the less social which is kind of a bummer. Guess its up to me to make the effort to be social."
Don't rule out switching hostels. I've done it myself when I didn't like the atmosphere of the one I was in.

Im 40 solo traveller and always stay in hostels. It's a hub of activity where you meet other like minded travellers and find out tips on things to see and do and get to learn about other people's culture and where theyre from which you wouldn't get from staying in a hotel by yourself. Have made awesome friends over the years which I wouldn't have had I chose to opt for th hotel or other accommodation style. Can't say I've done dorms as I always get a private with ensuite which works out cheaper than a hotel in most counties except Israel.

The full clip reveals she talked about how his wife was probably scared of him at home and couldnt speak for herself and that stuff. Hell I wouldnt wanna speak to her either!
"My improved posture has completely changed how men and women treat me in one dayI recently wanted to stop talking to women to focus on improving myself, and to detox, and very quickly, one of my self improvements was chest up, chin up and shoulders back. The look straighten my body from head to toe, and gave my vibe/look like one of those super confident attractive guys look that you rarely see. I have to admit, the results have been life changing. This all happened last 48 hours First off, a lot of women stare, and for much longer. The first women was on a date with a guy at a bar, and in-between small talk with the guy I had to go to the bathroom. Well, there are mirrors that I can see him and his date as I walk away either direction, and all I saw was this guy's date have the most memorizing stare I've seen on a girl. Right in front of him. Nothing held back. Beautiful girl btw, but I'm not a terrible person, so I would never encourage guy hopping while on a date. The look gave that ""this guy is so interesting"". They haven't been dating long it turns out. On the same night, a more heavy set girl and her friend stand behind me at the bar. I look behind me, and I see two genuinely nice smiles. I'm not into bigger women, personally, but I still found it really nice. Next day at work, a female customer did a tripple take at me. One coworker checked me out from head to toe with a smile, and a 2nd coworker is straight up looking to rebound her break up by putting a lot of really cute effort into being close to me, and having me notice her. She does these really attractive/confident stare with a smile. Did a little small talk, but the sexual tension was so intense. I might actually be down for what she's looking for. I actually really liked her sway when she walked passed me for no reason and then looked back at me to see if I noticed her. Her flirt was up to 11. last night, at the bars and club, another heavy girl flat out put my friend down because she thought he was ugly and I was attractive, and said she was down to fuck. That one pissed me off. So I shut her down by letting her know she's shitty. I leave to a new bar, and IMMEDIATELY, a wicked cutie hits on me which I assume is a one nighter she's looking for. I fucked that one up because I was so caught off guard, and ended up saying things that sounded like I was rejecting her. (Oops). I wasn't thinking before I spoke, so I ended up saying things that made her feel hurt. Finally, my male friend straight up told me I was clearly a really good looking guy. This one felt so nice, because he's a really good dude, and straight men don't normally tell me that. (Bless you) The rate of attention I got wasn't anywhere close to this before I decided to actually look confident. I also feel more powerful. I'm 6'4, and now look properly strong. Mentally and physically, girls and guy notice my vibe, and want to be around it. So now it's day three, and about to go to work. And make the bar after. Based on all the attention with my new posture, I look forward to how people will treat me. Update: at the bar right now. Haven't been looking around much, but have caught two 8s stealing glaces. One of them double takes and held the stare for a long time. Not sure how else to explain this shit."
Its not your posture lmfao
?
You standing straight up isnt making women look at you differently. What makes more difference a hunched back but friendly approachable face or a straight posture but you look pissed off? Your posture isnt making those things happen........
"I think it makes a huge difference. I definitely think I look far more attractive with my chest up, back straight and chin never looking down when I'm talking/walking."
"The posture is making your headspace more clear, which is its intention"
Lol what? Your brain isnt getting confused because of your poor posture. You want proof of that just stand at attention and see if you magically start getting peoples attention or have more clarity lol
"Wear clothes that are nice, but you dont vibe with and ur game will be shit. Wear OK clothes that you like, and youll game like a god. Its all in your head"
"So how about you provide us with a picture of you, or at least describe yourself, as i highly doubt putting your chin up would do all of that."
He followed rules 1 and 2
"Mate Im 64 and do all of these instructions because i used to be in the fucking army, yet i dont get the same attention, i would say Im fairly good looking and Im very intrigued by his report"
My picture is my profile pic. Maybe it's all just lucky timing
You're missing the point. An attractive person who hunches over doesn't display themselves as well as someone with good posture and it is very likely that person would notice a difference if they changed their ways. He's not saying that just because you have good posture you will have good success.
Good shit man it's a really big sticking point for me too. It's almost like I've wasted most of my time going out because my posture doesn't allow me to have good eye contact. Along with having a really quiet voice / bad tonality I end up hunching over and it's severely unattractive.

"This Scene Proves That Sherlock Does Appreciate His FriendsIn The Abominable Bride, Mycroft and Lestrade stay with Sherlock to dig up Ricoletti's grave even after Watson and Mary leave.

What are some sexual things you can say to a woman during a cold approach that are not directly explicit but are suggestive and could have a sexual meaning?
"A couple I things I said during my successful cold approaches: 1. You look like you could be an accountant... But a naughty accountant. 2. \[To a woman in a trench coat\] You look like you could be an exhibitionist. Essentially ""cold reads"" that include framing the girl as sexual, I suppose. Those particular ones I listed might be a bit more suggestive than you'd like, but feel free to take those and use as ""lines"" if you're ever in a position to use them. Huh, just realised I did this sort of thing in every successful approach I ever did. I should make sure to always do something like that."
"Funny how writing makes you realize things, isn't it? I liked the ideas. I should use cold reading more..."

"Woman lies to her kids, telling them they were raped (molested) by their dad just so they'll hate him."
And fuck lie detectors...
"While I don't like lie detectors, it obviously worked in this case. It was right on both accounts and forced an evil person trying to destroy an innocent man to admit she was lying."
"Idk what kind of lie detector they used in this clip but polygraphs are extremely accurate. They couldve just been using a simple heart rate monitor but a real polygraph is like 98% accurate because it checks your heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, electrodermal activity, and any body motion. Its a lot harder to beat a polygraph just by staying calm. heres a [source](http://clifton.mech.northwestern.edu/~me224/final_project_spring_2003/3.pdf) if you wanna learn more"
At the end she says please forgive me HOW THE FUUUUCK COULD YOU DO THAT?! Those women in the back (his daughters) look like they are in their 20s. Imagine having that lie told to you all your childhood and find out that it really is a lie! Redditors please respond! Would you trust either parent after you found this out?
Absolutely disgusting
Right would you trust your father or not talk to either?
"My mom didn't go to this extent towards me being raped. She always constantly told me how horrible my real dad is and how much he beat her, and raped her... she freaked out on me when I finally made the decision to see him. I was 16 when I finally met him. We both wore the same exact shirt and found out that my love of Hockey and music is because of him. He is a good guy just trying to live his best life. I am 27 now, and just had a great time having lunch with him and my stepmom a few weeks ago, and I just recently stopped having my mom in my life. I finally got tired of all the bs, and don't need that negativity in my life anymore."
"Ok, thats a bit sexist"
Found the feminist.
"What they said is exactly how feminists deal with men, they generalise."
"JuSt bE tHiN!! is complete bsThere are so many ways a body can be ugly, even when thin. You need good fat distribution, perky large boobs, no body hair, no cellulite, small labia, big butt, small waist, small shoulders, not be too tall or short, and even more rigid standards."
Living example of that
lol girl same.
being thin is better than being fat as you probably don't get pure hatred. but it may not bring you a bf
"Its not the be-all and end all but there's no point in having a big butt and being fat. Being thin ups your points. If a thin person gains fat, they lose points. Its like saying ""just shaping your eyebrows is complete bs."" Its these things that make you look better. There are plenty of flat chested and flat butt skinny white girls who don't struggle at all, because they're not facially ugly. I think for black girls with no shape its a lot harder."
"Yikes, awhile back, Ive complained about being ugly and unable to properly attract someone because of it and got told to lose weight. Like wtf? When I told them I was not fat, they then gaslighted me and told me it was in my head, they were not attractive and still managed to attract men and you could always get a man unless you were physically deformed. First off, it does not count if they were dating you to get pussy or they knew they couldnt do better and were looking to settle for second best. Second off, do deformed people not deserve love? Jesus."
"People who say that are oblivious to the fact only 2 body types are revered by the society. I only see pears and hourglasses in the media. Even plus-size models need to have certain breasts size and wear special pads (or sponges? I'm not sure what those are exactly). Hell, even thin women are encouraged to wear them. I remember r/ instagramreality posted one well-known kpop celeb whose hip pads were visible in one shot. Look, she's super thin and considered body goals by many. I'm not gonna dictate what a woman chooses to wear, but I'm so fricking tired of these same women boasting about being natural or idolized as if they were some angels. What's more, I don't see that many of them supporting body-neutrality or body-positivity (unless we count the blue-pilled take ""just smile, be confident"" or ""everybody's beautiful"" yada yada)."
r/butterface
"Yup. They just keep getting pickier and pickier. It goes from dont be fat -> be thin -> good hip to waist ratio -> long legs -> big butt/breasts -> cellulite and it goes on. A classmate called a girl's birthmark on her arm ""kinda gross"" one time. And they say women are the shallow ones"
"just be thin actual translation = jUsT bE slim thicc, with a flat stomach, perky boobs and bubble butt. no cellulite or body hair pls and thank you"
"Also even skin tone, clear face."
So I lost 60lbs and I'm still treated the same and ignored by most men. I can confirm that being thin isn't enough.
Thing is some otherwise attractive people are considered unattractive solely due to weight. In fact some people legit looked unattractive then they lost weight and others were like damn they are actually attractive or at least not ugly.

"Greatest tip you will ever hear.Yes, all the advice and books on seduction are important and hold golden information, but all of it comes second to the greatest advice you will ever hear. ""You are nothing. Everyone is basically nothing."" You are just smaller than a grain of sand in the time of the universe and everything you do will be forgotten in the infinite time of universe. No one really cares what you do and we are just biased. Go out and ask the woman you find attractive out, be super confident, if she rejects you, then who cares, it is NOT that important. Learn from your mistakes and move on. One day you will not be here. Use your time as most effectively as you can and enjoy the hell out of it."
"TL;DR: live your life, do anything you want, so you won't regret anything yo hadn't done when you are in your deathbed"
"This is solid advice. Works with everything, not just seduction"
No I do not believe you sre rewarding anyone but yourself. Your reply comes a bit mysoginistic. Getting with a woman when none of the two parties is interested is just a waste of time. Its not about falling in love or not. It is about finding someone who is willing to reciprocate love. It is way different.
"If women are waiting for men to make the first move does not mean that we are giving it to them easy. This is how society works. I agree that some men ruin it and come off too hard, but for the rest of us asking her out does not mean we love her or are attached to her, means we are showing interest."
"Leading the whole process even after the date. Society doesnt have to work one way. But when a non status quo creeps people out and theyre are basically just too proud to fundamentally see anything different, nothing can change. Girls, definitely CAN, approach or put in more effort."

There were 2 times where I scratching other cars - not really hitting just like a very close contact when driving a very narrow road. The owners aware of it and its small scratches. I always keep distance when driving in main road. Most of the scratches are from hitting front divider when parking and making sharp turn because I cant see it thus cant estimate how far my car is from the dividers. Still, its kind of worrying to keep scrapping dividers. I wish public transport is more accessible where Im living. Ugh.

How does one cheese a battle tower?
"Forgive me, brother Golems, for I am sinning... Fly in circles around the top with a Roc or another Lycanite mount. Summon Aegis with a staff and let them slice up the Golem (I will not forgive you). Keep circling. Profit. Or you can just blow up the whole tower with a beholder."
Youre gonna hear a heavy breathing that feels like its rumbling in your room and dont be surprised to figure out its a tower golem coming for his revenge
Or use knockback to throw the Guardian off of it
"Climb up the side of the tower where the chests are using a stack of blocks and then mine behind the chests, then steal the loot"
Just in time for a Djinn to knock you off 80 blocks. &#x200B; use water
"Guess I shouldve elaborated on my original post. How Id go about it is having a wall surrounding you, like having the 3 sides that arent the battle tower one higher than the block you are standing on. I dont ever cheese battle towers because I just go through the front door swinging but thats always how i thought about doing it How would water work? Like have water at the bottom so you dont die when you fall or quickly climb the tower, place a water bucket at the top and climb that way. Or is there another way?"
"Either works. As long as you have water as a crutch if you fall, you can build up or just water bucket climb."
"Better than knockback, get a punch enchant on a bow. Go to the top of the tower via flying mount or grapple Hook, Punch him off the tower from a distance, then safely raid the chests. Then you can go down to kill him, aegis help but it still takes time, and he'll still throw explosives at you the whole time. He drops a bunch of diamonds, so it might be worth it to you."

If I had her top half I would not give a shit about my face after. Couldnt stop thinking bout it Edited: I meant since my top half my face is hella deformed with a mediocre bottom half. I fool folks with my bangs so I was momentarily jealous here.
Most of the men that post there are porn sick and are only judging women who dont look EXACTLY like the pornstars they drool over on a daily.
"Does this moid even know the meaning of the term 'butterface'? If this woman is ugly, there is no hope for most of the female population."
This not an ig model. Shes a porn star. Shes very successful. She lives in LA. Ive been following her on all her platforms for awhile. She does alot of cam modeling and she also has her own website.
"*That* face scares him? Oooh boooi. His head would melt had he seen mine. I've never seen a woman use ""butterface"" when describing a guy or create such a sub. But go on about all women having high standards and hypergamy..."
He is a brainlet
"The comments about how they'd happily fuck these women but with bags on their heads are pure suifuel. Can't even show respect, need to insult women they find attractive or fetishize."
But they touch their pp to girls who look just like this daily.

She is pretty. Imagine me saying Liam Hemsworth or Tyson Beckford were ugly imao.
"Right arm only rowing pending collarbone surgery?I was hit by another cyclist last week and have comminuted fracture of the mid left collarbone with bayoneting of the fracture fragments. I won't see a sports ortho surgeon until mid week next, and don't know when I will actually have any surgery. I completed my ride although injured and have been tolerating the fracture without pain mediation since it happened. Left arm can be raised just below waist level only. I usually erg about 100k a month. I have tested right arm only rowing and it seems doable. Any opinions on one arm rowing as a modest effort to maintain some physical activity? There's always time for steady state, right? Postsurgery I will consult with the rehab folks. Thanks."
I also row and bike. I separated my AC joint in a bike crash and had surgery a few years ago. Missed the both sprint and head race seasons (masters). I borrowed a kickr from another rower and got a Zwift subscription. That kept me in shape and was very easy to do with one arm. Rowing with one arm just seems like a frustrating waste of time. I doubt youll get much out of it and a bike trainer will let you focus on cardio and leg watts without being distracted by holding on to a handle that wasnt designed for one sided use. My biggest bit of advice is to keep one sling for your arm while exercising and wear another one normally. Youll get very sweaty so its good to have one sling designated for workout duty. I used the jiffy sling they gave me at the ER when I was on the trainer so I wouldnt get my surgery recovery sling gross.
"Thanks. May go in that trainer direction, but have the C2 at home and no Kickr so defaulted to the erg. Good tip on the slings."
Mother found Not Guilty of injecting her daughter with her urine and laxatives

Cause people who post in this sub are either incels or just dense.
"Circumstantial god I hate that. That being said this is hardly a pussy pass. Had the doctors organised the proper tests to prove she was doing this she would have gone to jail. But they didnt provide concrete evidence on it, it was all speculation. This has nothing to do with the fact shes a woman."
Theres nothing about the evidence here. We cant say this is a pussypass without some kind of reason other than that she was accused but ruled Not Guilty. Maybe she actually didnt do it eh?
Maybe maybe maybe
That's a keeper. The girl is nice too.
I see your admiration and I concede. You can keep the fish and Ill make do with the girl.
Had the chance to meet her in the DFW airport. Shes even hotter in person!

Just a Instagram famous outdoors enthusiast. Just probably wouldnt be famous if she wasnt smoking hot.

"No Sponsored TabsHey there, Throughout Feburary, I was getting many sponsored tabs, but since last payout, around march 5th?, I have not received any. I have the option on, restarted brave, and even restarted my computer but nothing seems to work. Is there a reason for this or a problem only I am experiencing?"
"That is expected, since our sponsored tab campaigns begin and end (like any other advertising campaign). When the next one kicks off, your browser will automatically update to include it :)."

Anyone know what number I can call to get an edTPA rep on the phone rather than a machine???I just have a few questions for them.
I'm not sure what number you tried but I was able to get through on Friday using the number on their website (413) 256-2889 . It was a bit annoying because I had to go through several machine prompts and let them play all the way through before it gave me the option to talk to a person. It's probably an even longer hold time now because a lot has changed in the past 48 hours. Are your questions about what's happening with all the shutdowns or specific about your portfolio?
My question is if theyre thinking about getting rid of the edtpa this year. I dont know how or why they would keep it since just about every school if not all are closed so how would we be able to even complete it if we cant student teach? It makes no sense to me as to why they would keep it.
"As of right now, I haven't heard anyone say they are getting rid of it. Pearson is just about the money so they aren't going to call it off. I had to ask a specific question about my portfolio and they were running business as usual. Some states may waive it if the teacher shortage gets worse, but that wouldn't be decided any time soon. Do you have your lesson filmed?"
I have 4-5 vids that are crappy. I didnt want to submit any of them if I could help it.
Yeah I'm in the same boat. I'm just finishing up my video commentary and it's not that good. My college will help with retakes if we submit the 26th so I'm going to submit using the materials I currently have and hope for the best. It's a tough situation.
My college is allowing us a delay/extension with proof of school closures

"[Gaming] ""NINTENDO BANS CUSTOMER FOR REDEEMING SWITCH GAME PURCHASED ON G2A"""
"Archive links for this post: * **Archive:** https://archive.md/LjLpw ---- I am Mnemosyne reborn. I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do. ^^^/r/botsrights"
"IDK if this was a case of stolen codes, but seems like you can lose your account."
"G2A is kinda famous for ""Codes bought with stolen CC info""; if you want to buy anything with any sort of online component, stay away."
"And if you want to buy anything without an online component, don't. Instead, pirate because that at is unnoticed by devs vs buying G2A which actively harms them and costs them money. If you like the game, though, you should buy it from a real, non-thief retailer."
"Every time G2A comes up, I ask how someone can be that much of a penny pincher that they'd go to this shitstain hellsite to get a code, likely not attained legally, rather than just pirate the game? If you want to stick it to other digital retailers, buy from the devs directly; if you hate the devs, don't play the game at all; if you are so thirsty for this one product yet you aren't willing to get it through more legitimate means, why NOT just pirate it, then? I don't get it."
I almost bough one yesterday lol
G2A is infamous so I cant really fault Nintendo honestly.
"Well, this is a warning not to play stupid games and win stupid prizes then..."
What if he didn't know about the site's bad reputation? Not everyone does.
"I think at this point, someone should be doing research on these sites before using them. Their bad reputation is plastered everywhere, and OP even realized that now. They said that Nintendo will unban them once they get their refund through PayPal. If it was a irreversible ban, I would think that was too harsh, but he learned his lesson the hard way with no permanent harm done."
"While I don't agree with this on a consumer level, G2A can still go and fuck off."
"Nintendo has much less tolerance for G2A's bullshit. The game code was almost guaranteed to be purchased with a stolen credit card. According to the reddit thread linked in the article Nintendo is unbanning him and giving him a one-time pass, but also requiring him to officially request a refund with G2A/Paypal and provide proof. Steam is much more lenient because it doesn't hurt them. All the indie devs getting burned by G2A at this point are trying to sell their own keys. Steam allows them to do so for no cut. Steam doesn't get hurt by this. Accept a steam gift bought with a stolen credit card through G2A and steam will ban you."
"*""Oh wow, was it because it was a key acquired by fraud? I am so surprised. Ithough g2a and shops like that were genuine""* she said in a sarcastic tone. *""I really though companies would give the best prices to shops that also sell bots and hacks and china farmed ingame money.""*"
"Found on a forum, the OP asked if this girl he met online weighing 150 at 58 was fat. Not sure if this counts, but horrifying nonetheless."
Lmao I was 150 and 53 when I was rowing competitively in highschool but ok
"At my most fit I was 5'2"" and 145lbs. I was horseback riding 4 to 7 times a week with no saddle. My thighs were glorious!"
"the more comments i read by you the more i love you, man. my thighs are glorious but only cause they giggle, no muscle whatsoever...did ride bareback for 2 years straight though"
Awww thank you Mine are both muscular and jiggly. Thus they're gloriousness.
"I was my most fit at 5'6, 139. Swam 5 days a week and danced for 3."
"I'm 5'7 and weigh in the 140s. I'm slim, have always been slim. this guy doesn't seem to realize weight distributes differently for everyone and granted I didn't look at every weight chart out there, but of the few I did, none of them listed 150 at 5'8 as overweight. just say you only like super skinny girls and go."
"150 at 5'8 should be in the normal weight range, on the upper end. I'm 5'6 and 150, and I'm at 24.9. I can be overweight and a normal weight on the same day, depending what I eat and if I run or not. Of course, 150 looks like shit on me and I need to lose about 20lbs, but it could look better on someone with a better build."
General Overweight sounds like a GI Joe character.
"I'm aware that BMI is a pretty shit metric, but that's just at the top of what's considered healthy so this person is probably totally fine. Of course there's room for that to be a little optimistic given the variables, but keep in mind that she could be a body builder with 10% body fat or naturally very muscular with ~18% and weigh that much. It's dumb to judge based on height and weight. Love your body and yourself no matter who you are or what you look like while ALWAYS striving for a healthy lifestyle... ^Just ^don't ^^fall ^^^for ^^^HAES ^^^nonsense"
this dude would love eugenia cooley
im 170 and 57... well fuck me then.
"We point and laugh at the badwomensanatomy, we do not internalize it. We point and laugh at the badwomensanatomy, we do not internalize it..."
....ok?
"Let's see.... At that height and weight, I was walking several miles a day, plus spending at least 10 hours a week on horseback. I was also going hiking a couple times a month. I probably could have lost 10 pounds, but 150 is still within the normal weight range for a female of that height. My measurements were 37-24-38. Yup. I was a fucking cow."
"Scared about not having enough/Getting more suppliesHi y'all. I live alone in an apartment. I started prepping in late Feburary when I panic-bought beans, toilet paper, and paper towels online. In retrospect, I should've been less embarrassed about prepping, and I should've bought more, but that's my fear right now. From my late-Feburary panic-buying, I have enough food + supplies to last 1.5-3 months. But I'm worried it's not going to be enough. How are y'all coping with the fear of not having enough food? Are you guys planning on restocking? If so, how? Thanks! And stay safe and healthy out there!"
I am in constant fear of not having enough.
Same here.
Yup. Lost sleep over it last night. I feel you
"One long term, easily accessible prep to take care of this kind of anxiety is wheat which is very inexpensive at about 40 USD per 50lb (22.6kg) bag. That is low enough in price that you can continuously add new wheat to storage without impacting the bottom line. You can do the same with beans and rice, but they don't store quite as well, and you can do the same with pasta which also stores well. End result .. no worries, because you can prep long term with these kinds of dry goods for as long as you want, really .. and yeah, it might not be fun to sit around doing nothing but eating bread and drinking water, but you'd survive. I mean if you were super worried about some meteor hitting the earth or something, you could literally have half a U.S. standard short ton of wheat (1000lb) for 800 USD, which is like 1.5 MILLION CALORIES ... which at 2000 calories a day would last you like 700 days .. With enough storage space and about as much money as a car you could probably buy enough wheat or pasta to literally feed you for the rest of your natural life, and just check ""food"" off your list."
"I LOL'd at this. I have Celiac disease (not a hipster, I was diagnosed in 2014 with an upper endoscopy), so I can't eat wheat. 1000lbs of rice sounds good to me right now, tho :D"
I have issues specifically with wheat.. I also laughed... 1000lbs of wheat will take me out faster than covid-19
"Yep. Realized today I forgot baby wipes somehow (I thought I had a couple cases in storage but I guess not) and I have twins lol down to 4 packs, so I thought I'd get some.. except, NONE in any stores. Cant even find them online. Anytime I did find them itd be ""2 left in stock"" or something and before I could get to check out they'd be gone. (If anyone knows a store/website that has some that I'm not thinking of, let me know.. otherwise I guess I will be using cut up old t shirts lol) So now I'm like.. what else did I forget? What else won't I be able to buy?"
"I've cloth diapered before - cut up old shirts - flannel is best. You can use water or I used to use a mixture of water, coconut oil, and witch hazel (if I remember right I had to make sure it was alcohol free). As long as water is still running you can throw them in your washer - short cold cycle with just a bit of soap, then do a hot wash. If you search about cloth diapering you can find more info about washing"
Amazon has Water Wipes available
"My local drug store had some, Im in Southern California. Try rite aid & CVS!!"
"If still going out shopping, you could try places like Dollar General, Family Dollar, Big Lots, etc. The discount stores aren't quite as picked over as big-box ones yet, for some things..."
Didnt think of that! Thank you.
I feel this way sometimes and really want to keep eating fresh veggies and fruits as long as possible so I signed up for an imperfect produce box delivery every week. You can even add on things like bread and eggs. Im going to get that as long as I can to make the stockpile go further. Obviously I will disinfect everything that is delivered. There are a lot of these services and even local CSAs that will help a farmer stay in business. I also looked a Thrive Market. Their shipments are delayed 1-2 weeks but still taking orders. A lot of these services have coupon codes too. A last resort for me would be the dinner box kits. There are tons of intro offers for these on Groupon.
"Don't stress. Just know that you did what you could. I'm stocked for about 4 weeks of food food...and if worst comes to worst, I'll just have to eat rice and take vitamin supplements LOL. My plan is to order groceries and get what I can to restock my supply, and also be wise in how I am using my current supply. I'm being a little less generous with meat products and also eating everything in my fridge in the order of expiration. Saving every bit too, and re-purposing leftovers. Leftovers aren't fun...but they are more fun if you throw them into a new dish."

He will already have more class once he gets rid of this shallow broad.
"This writer understands not the dynamics of class. If I patronize the lower classes, the burden of beginning the interaction is on me. If I begin it, then class is maintained, and order is bolstered. This is the natural order of things, that the greater shall have control over the frame of communication with the lesser. It is only when the lower classes get uppity with thinking they can accost my person uninvited that the line has been crossed. Two fortnights ago, a Mrs. Bothby, a scolding and shrewish woman of ponderous comportment, made the mistake of crossing me in a forward manner. I alerted the parsons and had her in a wheelbarrow brought, stripped naked to her smock, and hoisted on the ducking stool for her insolence. In the twilight, after a day in the stool, she cried out to me, but I said naught as I calmly sipped my roadside chai and chatted with a passing rickshaw driver."

"> Since everything is currently going into lockdown now is the perfect time to focus on self improvement. Too bad the gym I go to also is closed indefinitely. Time for bodyweight workouts then. Pushups, pullups and everything in between. You should do a post on building muscle mass for skinny guys. It's really hard for us to look big."
So many of my clients are asking me for workout plans in light of gym closures my next article is going to address this issue directly. What I'll say is home workouts by yourself are usually too low intensity to produce results you need to coordinate group workouts in the park. People perform at a much higher intensity in small groups.
LOL my gym is 24 hours. Had the entire place to myself last night. Hard rock on the speakers. And I know the owner won't be closing any time soon.
Work out with 10-20 sets Per muscle group for 5 years.
"I used to be a skinny turd. Had an ""ectomorphic physique"". Got in touch with my Soviet Roots and started doing pullups everyday. When i got to 12 i added weight. Now i can do 4 pullups with my 100 lb girlfriend hanging on my back. My lats look like wings and I look like I can fly. To get a thicc joocy chest, lower the bar without flaring out your elbows, pause it over the nipple line and then burst up. Do that 10 times for 3 sets. Get in touch with your soviet roots too and do weighted dips. Do squats and deadlifts for a thicc joocy ass and legs. Problem solved"

Last month, for example, Beijing expelled three *Wall Street Journal* reporters in retribution for an opinion column titled China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia. *China Daily*, a Communist Party [mouthpiece,](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/07/WS5e3cab20a310128217275a06.html) declared the headline astonishingly racistdespite the fact the term sick man is routinely used idiomatically to [describe countries](https://www.ft.com/content/5a629584-610a-11e9-a27a-fdd51850994c) facing economic challenges, and isnt connected to the Coronavirus outbreak. > >In January, the Chinese embassy in Denmark [demanded an apology](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/29/WS5e309fb4a31012821727381f.html) after a Danish newspaper printed a cartoon related to the Coronavirus outbreak: a Chinese flag with virus icons where the stars should be. Embassy staff stated flatly that the cartoon is an insult to China and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people. In 2018, similarly, [Chinas ambassador in Ottawa](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/the-lies-and-insults-that-china-has-pointed-at-canada/) said Canadas arrest of a politically connected Chinese tech executive was motivated by white supremacy. (Beijing then retaliated by [arresting two Canadians](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50592055) in China.) The author, Thomas Brown, also spotlights both unethical media behavior and hypocrisy on the PRC's end: >Yet we must also be aware that the Chinese government has learned to weaponize our own progressive tendencies, and has learned to exploit false accusations of racism against democratic societies. Ironically, this same Chinese regime encourages racism and xenophobia domestically. > >Government-controlled Chinese media routinely stirs up nationalist hostilities. And Chinese television frequently plays on racial stereotypes. Chinas biggest Lunar New Year television show, with an audience in the hundreds of millions, in 2018 [featured skits](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2133558/racist-chinese-spring-festival-gala-tv-show-causes-consternation) with a black man playing a monkey and a woman in blackface with a huge posterior. In one [2016 ad for laundry detergent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/china-racist-detergent-advert-outrage), a Chinese woman stuffed a detergent pod into a black mans mouth and shoved him into a washing machine. Out popped a pale-skinned Chinese man. > >The *Global Times*, a state media outlet, is well known for [inflammatory, offensive editorials](https://qz.com/745577/inside-the-global-times-chinas-hawkish-belligerent-state-tabloid/) about foreign countries. One declared that should Australia continue flights over the South China Sea it would be a shame if one day a plane fell from the sky and it happened to be Australian. Given how the Chinese Communist Party is [already doing an amplified version of all of the above](https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1238349802338807808) in an attempt to deflect complicity in the coronavirus outbreak and blame the US for its own bungling...yeah, it's got global ramifications."
"Yeah, they're sure milking that Baizuo cow for what it's worth."
"Oh yeah, the CCP's ""proof"" backing its claims of America being to blame for the coronavirus? A Globalresearch.ca hitpiece, with a Japanese account noticing how said article was quoting Asahi, which is apparently known to have received CCP money: https://twitter.com/Tomo20309138/status/1238337777755811840 And I kid you not. This was posted by ""Spokesperson & Deputy Director General, Information Department, Foreign Ministry"" Lijian Zhao: https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238292025817968640 Further skimming seems to confirm that the ""Japanese research"" was inconclusive speculation spun by pro-PRC ideologues into some warped conspiracy theory about an American army spreading the disease. Also, no Japanese scientists were actually quoted at all, as it turns out the Asahi bit was sourced via PRC outlet Peoples Daily. EDIT: Adding some more context"
"I said this when it was reported that China was sending aid to Italy and Ill say it again: China is deflecting the origin of coronavirus (I aint calling it COVID-19 because China also wants that) so they can deny that it is a bioweapon that escaped containment from the Wuhan facility and avoid repercussions when its over with. They also most likely made this to use against the Hong Kong protestors and Taiwan. They are also using the social justice playbook that were used to seeing by calling everyone racist and sinophobic for blaming them for the virus. Edit: Also for those who want to criticize Trump, reminder that 1000 Americans died before Obama declared it an emergency during the H1N1 outbreak and the left is using this to push universal healthcare and their bullshit while simultaneously telling people not to politicize it."
"Dont forget how you have media outlets praising the effective Chinese measures. While conveniently sidelining how the Japanese were able to keep the outbreak under control and with relative calm. Or for that matter, how the Taiwanese (aka the REPUBLIC of China) handled it absurdly well and with much transparency in contrast to the PRC. Though you dont really hear much about how THOSE Chinese are leading the fight."

"This isn't surprising in the least. China is a postcolonial revanchist ethnostate, and its entire state ideology is really a kind of fascism driven by the same sense of humiliation which fueled German Nazism. Their entire state ideology is about reclaiming China's ""rightful position"" in the world as the ""middle kingdom"" (by which they mean the center of the world), which they see as having been ""stolen"" from them during the Century Of Humiliation (the colonial period). They were one of the first *incubators* of the ideology of post-colonial grievance. CCP ideology is basically Nazi, but replace ""Aryan"" with ""Han Chinese."" They demand Tibet and East Turkistan as *Lebensraum* for instance. Chinese Socialism has always been, from the very start, a nationalist project (even to this day, the CCP regards Sun Yat-Sen as its forefather despite Sun Yat-Sen being the founder of the rival Kuomindang). Of course the CCP lob the ""racist"" accusation at the West. Their entire state ideology is built on an experience of unfair treatment at the hands of Western colonial powers (and with some exceptions, such as Hong Kong, the simple reality is that the Western colonial powers DID treat China appallingly). The reality, however, is that the West eventually realized that racism, colonialism and the like were bad things. The Chinese government, on the other hand, has no such moral scruples. Imperial China, and even present-day China, engage/d in absurd levels of racism and colonialism (they subjugated their Asian neighbours frequently, with no remorse whatsoever). I mean the blunt reality is that slavery, oppression, imperialism, colonialism and such was the *reality of human history up until the last few centuries*. Almost every civilization engaged in these things to some degree, and almost every civilization was the victim of these things to some degree. The West *absolutely* engaged in them... just like everyone else. The West's record is distinguished only by two things: first, the formalization of the scientific method and the resultant industrial revolution made the West more capable at engaging in these things. Secondly, the ideas of the enlightenment ultimately made Westerners come to the conclusion that slavery, racism, imperialism and colonialism were all bad things. The West didn't invent slavery, but the West was the first civilization to abolish it. Yet the West is asked, unlike every other civilization, to contemplate and repent for its own sins. Despite the fact that we were the first people to realize they were sins, and the first people to develop a philosophy which consistently opposed all of these things. When the Chinese government calls you a racist, tell them to look in the mirror. There's a reason the Christchurch Gunman said the PRC was the state most aligned with his values... the PRC is a fascist, ethnonationalist, racist, colonialist shithole, and Beijing is guilty of every sin it accuses the West of committing."
"All good points. Though to add briefly, it also pays to spotlight the Taiwanese/ROC: as on top of being themselves shaped by the Century of Humiliation, they followed a different postcolonial path that makes them as close to what a Free China would be like as one could imagine. Meanwhile, the PRC conveniently treats them simultaneously as infantile idiots, corrupted by the evil colonialists (by that they usually mean Japan and the US) and traitorous rebels."
"That's very true. The ROC is post-colonial yet it doesn't see the West as its enemy or its eternal oppressor. The PRC of course treat the ROC as having ""colonized minds"" (basically calling them ""bananas"" - yellow on the outside but white on the inside). They use the same insult toward Hongkongers."
"Pretty much. It's pretty fucked up, indeed. Especially when you factor in the legacy of the Cultural Revolution and the post-1990 ""patriotic reeducation."""
"Agreed. Its completely demented. But that's their ideology for you. They don't oppose SJW ideology... they wholeheartedly embrace several core aspects of it, and are happy to weaponize it. They're evil."
"You're not wrong. It's the reality behind ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"""

"Broad Ripple Ping Pong MeetupI want to start a Broad Ripple ping pong meetup and could use suggestions for potential meeting spots. My thought is that perhaps I could buy a couple of ping pong tables and convince a local community center allow me to host the events and store the tables there for a fee. First, is anyone interested in joining a meetup like this? Also, anyone have ideas for locations? Here are the only location ideas I've thought of so far: Ask the Indianapolis Arts Center (seems like a stretch, but worth a shot) Transport the tables to a local park, like Broad Ripple Park or Canterbury (maybe by laying some portable table tops on top of picnic tables?) Give up on hosting in Broad Ripple and either host at Smash Social downtown or the outdoor tables at Carmel's midtown plaza"

Thanks for the tip! I hadn't thought about Big Car Collective. I'll consider contacting them.
There are already 2 ping pong bars and a place on Washington St. where all the really good players play.
"Thanks, I'll consider those places if I can't make Broad Ripple work. You have a good point about good players already being there, though. What's the place on Washington? A bar?"

Check out a place called Smash

Omg I've seen so many hot guys in the media from Australia
Men in autralia are not handsome. Dicks are better here in my country. Id rather get a ugly one with a good D then a handsome one with a penis pencil
"Even in white countries, Brazil is known for gorgeous women. How do you mean you are 'different' from your peers?"
"Women here are beautiful the competition is insanely high, you will see a lot of beautiful ones with ugly fat asses men. I think I am average, which could classify me as below average in comparison to my female friends ( in my view)"
"All that women looking the same, they all look like they came from the same form. Youre different, youre unique, you dont feet their beauty standards you have your own."
"It's why idgaf about Instagram beauty standards. The most famous ones are hot without photoshop. If I delete instagram, I might as well walk around with my eyes closed. Attractive people are everywhere."
On a thread about Billie Eillish body shaming
"Can't dispute that. Even on Twitter, for example, it's common for someone to mock a male user by calling him a ""virgin"" or saying he has a small penis. Even high profile female Twitter users get away with doing this."
Women shoot themselves in the foot when they insult men for being virgins. If youre saying a man has no worth because he doesn't have sex with girls it's not a stretch to then conclude that a woman has no worth to a man without sex.
"Virgin man is truly one of the harshest insults there is. Unless you're a volcel, the insult literally means ""genetic trash unfit for reproduction"" and the validity of the insult comes from real life experience as no woman has ever thought otherwise. It's also why virgin isnt an insult for women."
That's not what they re alluding to necessarily. It's just means you're inferior or defective because you cant attract women.
Everything he says is true until the last sentence. You dont get ridiculed for being born with a dick. You get ridiculed for being born beta male with a dick.

"The Taylor Swift video cracked me up as she was comparing herself to the top .001% on Wallstreet or Fortune 500 ceos. Those are people that have advanced degrees, gotten up at 4am and grinded for 30-40 years to get where they are. She made her fortune writing angsty break up songs targeting tweens. Her road to success was 1000% easier and faster than the men she represented in her video. Tay tay, you dont just get to show up and be the man."
"I'm a bit desperate to find an IDE / Editor tool set that actually worksIt's been now a couple of weeks since I've started learning Haskell. **My impressions so far:** It's beautiful. The syntax is clear and unlike other languages like scala you're not constantly wondering: ""Is this actually functionally pure?"", because the language itself won't allow you to write impure code. Anyways, now I wanted to start a larger project and learn about game development with the ""SDL2"" library. At a first glance game development in haskell sounds like a great idea as it allows you to write nice, stable and composable functions. I finally learned enough about stack, cabal and the project structure to get the libraries installed. I wished there was more beginner friendly documentation, but I managed. **The part I did not manage to get through, is the the environment / toolset part.** And it's not because I need more knowledge, but I'm finding a LOT of bugs that break something. **Intelli-J default plugin** * Best experience so far. Easiest to install, but it does not have a debugger as far as I know. **Intelli-J haskforce** * Crashes at start. I tried to compile the latest bug-free version but the gradlew script also crashes. **HIE** * Crashes. Haven't gotten it to work. **GHCIDE** * This one works pretty well, however there are some undocumented errors that happen with certain default files. For example I have to delete ""Setup.hs"" for it to actually work. There is veeeery little documentation on how to create a ""hie.yaml"" file to exclude these files. **Phoityne-vscode debugger for VSCODE** * Crashes as well trying to debug a .hs file that definitely compiles and runs. It complains about some characters when jumping over to the next function. I'm pretty desperate because so far I have spent much more time trying to build the toolset than to actually code anything. So, if you allow me the question, what is the current best editor / IDE / toolset combo as of 2020? Something complete and easy to install. I really don't want to leave haskell, because it's the most popular ""pure"" functional programming option and it's got a lot of documentation and quite a healthy community. I just need something that works :) Thank you!"
"Here is a [good article](http://marco-lopes.com/articles/Vim-and-Haskell-in-2019/) about setting up vim and Haskell: . If you use VS code, it should be similar, maybe a bit easier. In case you are learning the language, you may not need a full IDE now. Just normal setup with syntax highlight is good enough IMHO. You also can use ghcid to get fast feedback loop when development. Hope this helps!"
"I've been making the same effort with some success using vscode and haskell extensions. Would it be possible to post the code that causes the crash? I would be interested in seeing if I run into the same problems. Also, what kind of computer are you using?"
"Im also in the same boat trying to find a consistent, robust plug in for VsCode. Nothing seems to work on Mac. One plugin that supports minimal information giving, causes ghc to run continuously at a high cpu usage and drains my battery"
"I use vs code and hie on Darwin with stack for simple projects and nix+cabal for complex projects that may require nontrivial tool chains. I usually build and install hie from source (stack) or use a pinned version from nixpkgs. On large (100k loc) projects, Ive really only been able to use ghcid but maybe that will change when ghcide and hie merge."
Do you use VSCode and Windows? In the following days I'll be posting a tutorial on how to set up a dev environment for Haskell with no prerequisites. I even got GUIs with GTK working!
"I use Geany. Its feature set is the smallest, but it can syntax highlight, smart indent, jump on next error. That is enough for me. In return : It never lets me down. No hang up, never, every action \[including startup\] is instant. No bugs."
"I personally think effective development in Haskell doesn't really need any editor integrations. Vim, a couple of terminals, and hoogle is all I really need."
"I use ghcide + ghcid in vscode. HIE and ghcide have been improving a lot in the past 6 months or so, and soon these projects will merge. The IDE thing is a major problem but I'm comfortable with these for now."
"I use emacs and dante both for personal and professional use and have made [minimal-haskell-emacs](https://github.com/soupi/minimal-haskell-emacs) which can serve as an easy way to get started. It has some issues, for example you should build your project to install the dependencies before running the editor, if you add a new package you should build and run `M-x dante-restart`, and you should give it a few moments when you are opening a big project for the first time, but it generally works. And on an unrelated note you might be interested in [my talk on purely functional games](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2018/07/24/pfgames)."
"I second dante, and this is how I use it http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/how-i-use-dante/"
"I'm trying to tie NixOs, Emacs, lsp-haskell, haskell-ide-engine and cabal together, and its a nightmare. Especially the parts involving nix shells, building local libraries, cabal2nix etc. are a mess."
"I know the IDE thing came across all the time, yet lots of people manage without. Maybe people who don't use a IDE don't know what they are missing. Could you list which features you are missing? I'm pretty sure most of them can be sorted with correct setup. I'm using vim + ghci (and fzf plugin) and I am getting 98% of what I needed from spacemacs and a bit more, like type under cursor without any external tool (just plain ghci connected to vim via tmux)"
"We're writing a simple guide for exactly this for ZuriHac 2020: https://github.com/zfoh/haskell-simple-install The guide is tested on all 3 operating systems. It's pretty much done, but we're still working on some polish. Like you noticed, you can hit some snags with ghcide, but I promise you that you're 90% there! You're right that the `hie.yaml` in relation to `ghcide` is not well documented, I think a lot of this will improve over the near future. I had success with looking at the [sample files](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/blob/master/hie.yaml.cbl) from HIE (they work for ghcide). One reason things are in flux is that a) ghcide is not that old, and b) efforts are probably going into https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server right now. But please open pull requests with documentation fixes, or write a blog post once you figured it out."
"I'm going to put in another recommendation for [**Emacs with Dante.**]( https://github.com/jyp/dante ) You can install Dante through Emacs' own package manager. Even without Dante, the ordinary Haskell language mode is pretty good, and using `cabal v2-build` does all the hard work of managing your Haskell dependencies. If you'd prefer Vim bindings, I'd go with [Emacs Doom]( https://medium.com/urbint-engineering/emacs-doom-for-newbies-1f8038604e3b ), which is the Emacs core with a whole-new user interface built around it that I think VS-Code users would find to be pretty comfortable (except maybe the Vim key bindings)."

"Personally I would prefer putting my car in a 2 car garage. Lots of storage space, backing in would be easier, plus larger spaces are just positive in general. Also it would mean I could afford my own home with a 2 car garage. Plus, you know, second car space, for friends or the SO I hope to have over. Oh. This was a loose vagina metaphor. Maybe it's just you and your total lack of experience with human anatomy you aren't physically attached to?"
"I don't think being told repeatedly would make the slightest difference for a lot of these people. It's not about not knowing the facts. It's not even about believing what they're saying - most of them probably haven't put a moment's thought into *how* having sex would make a vagina stop working like a muscle. For them, it's just about having a stick to bash women with. The more women tell them they're wrong, the more the same jokes keep making other men laugh, the more they want to hang on to the same old stick."

Clark and Zuparic on the bench for TOTW 2
First of many for Dario Hopefully
"Nice! As a child-bound cord-cutter I haven't been able catch any games so far and was just about to ask here how Zuparic has been playing. Upgrade from Tuiloma (who I've always liked), then?"
"I think they were both solid, but not outstanding. I haven't been too impressed with Zuparic, he looked really bad in the final preseason game (got beat twice for goals) and wasn't all that much better last week. He was better yesterday, but much of that could also be due to the much more conservative setup and playing a weaker side in Nashville. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he is still adjusting to the league"
"Im not blaming Zuparic for those goals. He had to step to cover the near post and nobody had his back covering the far post. Gios tactics set the team up to fail. Hes got fullbacks playing as wingers, wingers as central mids or fullbacks, and is pressing a high line when our pace and communication are poor. Zuparic has been the best thing on the backline so far."
"I'd have to go back and rewatch to be sure, and of course defending is a team thing. Being the best thing on our backline might be the lowest bar ever. I think he can and hopefully will be good, I just think he has been off the pace so far. Again, I'm willing to give the the benefit of the doubt, but I think it would be inaccurate to describe his play as good so far."
Love to get downvoted for having an opinion lmao
Maybe Gio is working up to trying to become the next USMNT coach.
> Zuparic has been the best thing on the backline so far. This is the right take. Any errors have been systematic and not individual. His positioning and timing of when to step have mostly been spot on - but others around him have failed in their individual responsibilities.
Very very VERY generous to Zuparic. I thought he had a decent enough game but his play was only noticeable for how bad our defense was last week. Compared to that as a defensive unit they improved by miles and are still a few marathons from being a formidable backline.
"I believe Duvall belongs on there, he played very well for his first start with the Timbers."

i mean. anyone that has died twice and gets away... gets a pass from me on merit alone
"Literally her second accident resulting in a death in a decade. Was high, doing 180km/hr (110mph), looking at her phone whilst disqualified from driving, in a stolen car and evading arrest. That sentence is so insufficient it is insulting to the victims family."
This is an insult. Why do the innocent always have to pay the price? Youd think at some point the universe would do the world a favor and have her car be the one rolling and crushed.
"Some excerpts from the article. >A woman who killed an Adelaide delivery driver while driving drugged, disqualified and in a stolen car will serve at least five years and seven months behind bars.

She shouldn't even be driving. >Judge Tracey banned Brine from driving indefinitely once released from prison, until a court order allowed her to do so. >""Your offending is a very serious example of this type of offending you were on drugs, evading police, in a stolen car and you were disqualified,"" she said. >""You had the previous experience of causing the death of someone known to you.

>ugly guys easily trick girls into sleeping with them where I live ...I find this sad
"It's just true cumbrain nature being expressed. All males have a primitive hatred for ugly women. But most males can date women that are up to their standards more or less and so they just ignore ugly women's existence instead of attacking them. But some are sexually frustrated because they can't get the 7/10 they want and are forced to settle for a 6.5. Those guys feel the need for an outlet for their frustration online. It's telling just how much of online content is dedicated to scrutinizing women's facial bones and the size of the fat sacks on their chest. Truly the rational sex, focusing on the issues that matter :D"
"This is true but at the same time there are definitely still chads that talk shit about women online, in my experience, mostly male minorities talking shit about women of their own race"
"true, men of color can be sickos when it comes to internalized racism =/ and yeah chads part take in ""locker room talk"" but idk i feel like men online are far more aggressive than in real life."

I'll never forget [a Marvel artist stealing Tau and Eldar vehicles.](https://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/689643.page)
"I had never seen all of those. They were so lazy in their copy job that they KEPT THE FREAKING TAU LOGO?! There is lazy tracing, and then there is whatever THAT is."
"The backgrounds look like rendered CGI models so they probably just swiped some fanmade models. I mean, you can *see* the polygons on surfaces that are supposed to be curved."

That's...undeniably theft of their art.
He should get off Twitter and file a lawsuit.
I do not think you can copyright fan art.
"I think those rules only apply if the artist tries to make a profit off of it. Otherwise, taking a picture of a building or painting a landscape would open someone up to lawsuits."
"I love how it looks slightly retarded when compared to the original. Being bad at tracing says a lot about the ""artist""."
"u/joelaw9 Well if there were any doubt before, it's gone now!"
I miss old bunny riven :cIa there a way to get her back ? :c

No they don't. Show me a source on that.

"The Riot TR boards post referenced in this reddit post makes it clear that the issue with the lolskin software is that it enables player to use Riot skins that you normally pay for, for free. This practice is called ""skin hacking"" or ""skin porting"" and is unanimously rejected by the modern custom skin community. At least, it is the case for VoXskins, the community I'm a part of. The problem didn't ever stem from the ability to use custom, fan-made skins. Custom skins are something that Rioters actually find pretty cool, and modders are usually very involved players. There's always been a gray area and a tolerance towards us, and it is clear that custom skins haven't ever been a legitimate ban reason. Any person that was banned because they used custom skins were banned because they installed their mods through a software that was bundled with other unfair features. This was the case with MKLoL / MKJogo, which added an unfair advantage through jungle timers (didn't exist in game at all back then). This is also the case with LoLskin: it isn't an unfair advantage but that software hurts Riot's business strongly by jeopardizing their main source of income. The widespread use of LoLskin is what pushed Riot to decide to make it bannable. Nowadays, custom skins can be installed using clean software that was developed by members of the custom skins community, that aren't bundled with any features that could pose a problem with Riot's business or give an unfair advantage. The community closely pays attention to what is distributed so that we remain in the best terms with Riot possible. TL;DR lolskin is bannable because it gave you free skins client-side, not because of custom skins"
"im using this for a long time now, still not banned: [http://leagueskin.net/p/download-mod-skin-2020-chn](http://leagueskin.net/p/download-mod-skin-2020-chn)"
"The ban waves are on a server to server basis. If you play on a server where the software isn't used a lot, then it's unlikely you'll be banned. I still advise against the use of this software."
There's a way to do that actually! I'm working on bringing back Riven's old particle effects
ok this is cool :)))))))))))))))))))))))
"The way that men on Reddit have tried to manipulate women into liking short men is disgustingAnd I see some women starting to make virtue signaling posts like Short men are attractive too, i only care if hes taller than me etc. because as soon as guys feel insecure women feel obligated to rush to placate their feelings. Meanwhile men have a laundry list of preferences, standards, and REQUIREMENTS for womens physical beauty. Some of their preferences are breast size/shape, nose size, WHR, hip width. And the most common argument the short guys have is well you cant change height!! 1. You cant change the above things unless you are willing to risk your life, take time off from work and lose money, and drop >5k on implants or surgery, which guys shame you for anyways. 2. Why does it MATTER that you cant change your height? Ok? Should women immediately be sympathetic because you have an unfixable feature and start to have a preference for it? Its double standards. Im glad theres a feature for men to widespread be insecure about. Because women are picked apart and microscopically dissected for their features. Men dissect an oblivious woman walking by, with their friends as a social pastime. Its disgusting. Women, dont feel guilty for having a height preference. Men have just about every preference under the sun!"
"Yeah the thing is lots of men want to be immune to rejection. So people saying women should give short men a chance make me wonder where is the parade of men telling other men ""dude you should give hairy chicks a chance! It's awesome!"" Or ""fat chicks are so soft bro it's heaven!"", or ""that chick has a big nose - hey that means she's a catch!"". Answer Is, no where, but women who are hairy or are chubby or have a big nose or whatever else thing men find unattractive have to ask for basic respect. Not attraction just respect. So go ahead and like tall guys. I say the same thing to them as they told me: ""people not finding you attractive isn't oppression""."
The fact that they will fuck such a woman and never speak to them again is supposed to be enough Didn't you hear?
"Loool it's so pathetic. They've had generations to run around shouting out about how they only like women with x y z. Now that women don't have to rely on mens money to survive, we can truly listen to what biology tells us and date guys we're attracted to. I agree, women really need to stop bending over backwards. I dont mind somewhat shorter men that I keep that to myself (the whole debacle is turning me off men shorter than me completely tbh but I'm a femcel so what I like doesn't matter lmao). All I say is that women are allowed to have preferences and it's the only thing I'll say. I hear men going on and on about ""petite"" this and ""petite"" that. Blackpeopletwitter loves to make fun of ugly women but bring up short men in that thread and they get mad. The infamous angry short man who claimed he couldn't get dates lied. He even recorded one of his many dates where he abandons a woman in the snow. It's a power issue, they're have to accept that they're not rich Adonis' that all women lust over and get a hobby instead. 5'8-5'10 guys (literally.average heighted guys) whining about height is flat out pathetic. You're taller than most women so it's not your height mate. Beauty standards are beauty standards. If height makes a man ugly to women then oh well. Scandinavian countries are doing fine."
I have an upper limit because I'm 5'4 but idk about /short/ short guys...
"It is gross, but tbh I've seen just as much of women trying to make men like fat women. People just need to stop trying to make objectively attractive people like objectively unattractive people - cause you *know* anyone who's obsessed with making these points are objectively unattractive people who are mad they can't have the objectively attractive people like them. Which is just... hypocrisy to no end."
"Maybe but women don't really have to make men like fat women like men have to make women like short men. A fat woman can have a great face, skin, and just more tits and ass which pleases some men. A short man is visually less of a man. There is no male virtue that touts manletism. This is why those men accepting fatter women is less of an effort and many of it do it themselves Men are not more virtuous for being willing to fuck anything Women looking for men are not seeking just anything to fuck. They are looking for long term That is why this isnt a good comparison. I agree with the rest but lol humans gunna human"
"Dunno. I feel like the body positivity movement is more women saying they don't deserve to be treated less than because men find them physically unappealing than saying guys *have* to date them. On the other hand, the rhetoric from not conventionally attractive men feels way more manipulative. Look at all the guys defending male mass murderers or men who commit violence against women. It's basically, ""date us or we'll kill, maim you, etc."""
Exactly. I like taller guys not crazy taller. Not to say I never like a guy whos 54 or 56.
Lmao Im at work and the title actually made me laugh. But I agree theyre pathetic.
theyre allowed to talk about and question beauty ideals and how it hurts them just like everyone else. theyre allowed to be angry about it too though we know itll do them no good. some use it as a veil for their misogyny but it is thin and we can see through it.
"Sure. Vent. I dont care. But dont try to GUILT women into finding you attractive so you can get your dick wet. Go into any r/unpopularopinion post. We can even play Manlet Bingo or something. Take a shot every time a guy says, they are shallow you dodged a bullet says something about fat women you can lose weight but you cant gain height. These are clearly arguments trying to vouch for women to start being attracted to short men, or at least start questioning their preferences. They want women to see that height is unfixable so that women can feel bad and begin to date short men out of pity. Believe me. I was one of them. I started to look at my own mental processes and condition myself to find short men attractive. Not gonna do that. Men dont do the same when it comes to darker women, fat women, women with bad teeth, women with flat chests asses or no hips, etc. Im not going to do introspective psychology work to get head pats from short men and women shouldnt, either."
""" Its double standards. Im glad theres a feature for men to widespread be insecure about. Because women are picked apart and microscopically dissected for their features. Men dissect an oblivious woman walking by, with their friends as a social pastime. Its disgusting."" Goddamn, this comment. And esp. that last sentence. I feel sorry for all ""ugly"" people (including frustration for myself, obviously). And guilt, therein. But you're not wrong about the many things that are immutable for women, tied to femininity (that's why being short is so torturous finally - short men feel disrespected by men and women)...and that sense of obligation to comfort isn't quite there."
"The worst thing is that WHR is just a very under the radar thing that men probably doing consciously acknowledge but still judge women on. It's the difference between hot bod and not, whether they realise it or not."
"What rejection looks like?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69RlADEuY80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69RlADEuY80) When we think of rejection we often imagine a very painful experience but its important to remind yourself that this is just your imagination and that its better to be present, curious and see for yourself. Personally I was amazed at the variety of reaction you can get and it's important to realize that at the end of the day, everyone around you is a human being, you can talk to them and however they react, as long as you are polite and well-intentioned, they are no reason to censor yourself. You can and will learn from every situation. I made a short video showcasing various kind of vibes and reactions, enjoy :) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69RlADEuY80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69RlADEuY80)"
"Yeah, this guy has it. These are roughly how my interactions go with most women in rejection or in success. There is nothing to be embarrassed about, nothing to be angry about. Very simple, no problem."
"imagination is so powerful, sometimes you have to be present and embrace reality, it's often much sweeter than you imagine :)"
It's just a numbers game.
"Yeah also worth mentioning you shouldnt get mad at a women no matter what her reaction is. After all, youre approaching her and not the other way around."
He got the invitation from the therapist. He should have gone for the insta-date.
Hahah yea instant regret
"Can w xx, a,, be Co co my 77%03130."
"Looks like you're french and in SF. I am both of those things too. T'as l'air d'avoir ton game au point, mais si jamais t'as besoin d'un wingman ou de quelqu'un pour te hold accountable et te pousser approcher, c'est avec plaisir."
I got anxious everytime he got rejected
And that is the reason game doesn't work on the majority of us here. We fear rejection and stay on our chair never doing an approach. I am wondering: It must be another way besides cold approaching so we can get what we whant.
It is time to accept that most guys don't approach! Fact!
if I was like him - looks - I have never problem with girls. So what is the point?
"He got rejected in every scene lol. You think all those girls really had BF's, that's just something women say. I never take it literal."
"MBTI types ranked top to bottom by how cool I think they are(not necessarily my compatibility with them). What are yours?Also I'd like to hear who u think is cool vs who you are compatible with. Like I think ESTPs are dope as hell, but I feel like the intensity of their personality takes away from my personality. (Within groupings I like the types more or less the same amount) ENTP ESTP ISTP INTP &#x200B; ENTJ INTJ INFJ &#x200B; ISFP INFP &#x200B; ISFJ ISTJ &#x200B; ESTJ ESFJ &#x200B; ESFP ENFP ENFJ &#x200B; Note: \-On avg, I value Thinking more in men than women."
I shall accept this placement.
Heres mine ENTJ ENTP ESTP ESFP INTJ INTP ESTJ INFJ ISFP ENFJ ISTJ ESFJ ISTP ENFP ISFJ INFP
"u are making me debate my placement of ESFP. I most of them respect them from afar, but not when I really get to know them in my opinion(from the literal 1 I have been close with). also im moving entj up a tad."
and what ISTP so low for??
the one i have known is very boring. This doesn't mean all istps are boring but this is from my experience
"Excuse me? Whats with that ENTJ above ENTP? As an ENTP we are superior because were not little sheeple following rules, regulations and schedules and all that."
They get shit done.
Same as yours but the first part like this ENTP INTP ESTP ISTP
What even is this sub anymore. Am I the only one over 12?
ya you're the only one.
Why do you value a T in a boy than girl?
cuz as a girl I'm more attracted to guys who aren't emotional. guess it doesn't matter too much for friends tho.
Ohhh you meant as in romance. I was thinking romance and in general.
"??? Profit!Reinstalled QC and found out my old acc data from 1,5 years ago. On that account i still had 1,7k shards. I remember i was saving up shards back then for possibly cheaper future unlocks. So now i could buy all the champions and max all of them for \~70 shards each. I have every mastery shader and all the special skins now. Nice. Thanks Bethesda for thinking this trough... ps: i knew someday it would pay off not investing 30 in the champions pack."
"Bethesda most likely: ""But you don't have the Ranger Early Access skin, that will teach you"""
True. And to be honest i don't even care about the skins at all. I mainly play slash and i'm still using the set i had before because it looks better. Was just using reddit as my personal blog again.
"This is because of the ""lootpocolypse"" that took place when the progression system changed from loot boxes to a seasonal battlepass.

Chelsea Manning to be released!
At least we get some good news for a change.
"Hijacking top comment to post her legal teams fundraising page. She may be out, but $256,000 in fines arent going away overnight. And thats not even to mention the fact that the fascists have more than demonstrated they are willing to send her back to jail at a moments notice over nothing, or to bring up the financial help she could also doubtlessly use to address the unspeakable torture she has undergone over the past decades. https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/chelsea-manning-needs-legal-funds-to-resist-a-grand-jury-subpoena"
"Thanks, comrade. I think I'll donate a little in the morning. Of all the things I could spend my money on, this is probably one of the most worthy of it."
Oh my god this makes me so happy
Hoorah!
Finally some good news. Hope she will recover.
nan
"I just commented on this yesterday, although the powers that be cannot undo her suffering at least now she is out of prison. This made my day. Fuck the US justice system and long live freedom."
Now to hang out with fascists again i can only assume.
"Extremely go fuck yourself I know what you're talking about and there's a time to discuss it, but you are in the wrong place for this conversation considering everything she's gone through and still has to go through in the coming hours, days, weeks, .... years... dec.... Read the fucking room."
Can you DM me some details or a starting place to look into this? Good faith inquiry
"Really glad she's finally getting out but I can only imagine the damage done to her, she has undergone some major torture and I don't know how one can recover but let's hope."
Finally a touching sign of humanity. Shes been through hell and back. Such good news.
Fuck yeah!! Damn celebrate the wins we get mfers!
"I have the exact same problem, I look decently handsome but damn! Im awkward as F sometimes, I need to be trained lmaooo"
You can start incrementally. Start by going for 8s.
Or two 4s at the same time.
Why not 7? 4s are no fun. Not that hard to find to kinky willing girls if youve got the skill set to attract a 7 already.
Wooosh.
Ohh in that case why not 4 2s
"Find them online. I've done some practice on tinder with openers, even if I have no interest, it's a way to dial in your approaches with no social embarrassment. Try to get the hottest girls to reply on tinder."
"You have to match with them first lmao , hottest girls on tinder swipe left on 80% of men"
Fair nuff
the hottest girls on tinder are swiping left on 95% if not more of men
You just need confidence. If you dont believe you can do it then you wont be able to.
"You most likely subconsciously go for women you find to be in your league. And its not just you, in fact, studies have shown that most people tend to go for people they believe are obtainable. Its basically another way of putting beautiful people on a pedestal. You may perceive them as being higher value, solely due to their physical beauty. Its easy to believe that they are better than you, and that they would never even think of being with someone like you because you are not attractive/intelligent/funny/wealthy/interesting enough. Now, does that mean that you have to limit the amount of women you try to attract? Of course not. But it does mean that you have to work hard at changing your perception of other people. How is a beautiful woman supposed to find value in you, if you dont believe you possess value enough for her?"
How about you post a picture then well tell you whether you should go for the 8s and above?
Anyone one can get a ten even If your a 1

Why this mature and responsible human being isn't get the love he deserves ?
r/Inceltears shut down lolAnyone know why? Good riddance. They purposely misconstrued our purpose for karma.
"Holy crap, I'm so glad. They were insufferable."
"""Insufferable""! That's such a good word to describe IT users! Seriously, their irrational superiority complex and forced ""humour"" was so tiresome whenever I checked on that subreddit. There was a woman who proudly claimed how absolutely she loved to suck her 5'5"" husband's cock and that she does it regularly. I never cringed so hard in my entire life. What kind of person boasts about her supposedly ""amazing"" sex life on an anonymous forum dedicated to kick in people who are at their lowest? What an unhappy, insecure, repulsive weirdo. Not to mention their evergreen platitudes about ""looks doesn't matter/ looks matters a bit, but its importance is insignificant"". Or my personal favorite: ""If you want to be loved, you have to love yourself at first"". Oh, really? I has always been self-loathing, but that didn't prevent me from recieving hookup-offers, and there's a guy who's been interested in me for months now and would accept me as his girlfriend anytime. He knows that I'm not the most optimistic person and that I'm quite bitter about a lot of things, but he still likes me together with my flaws. How could that happen, dear IT?"
Tbh thats really intriguing. I wonder what happened
I too would like to know what is behind the shutdown. Was it the greater Reddit or was it the folks who started it? Also I would like to know what the thought process was around the decision.

"When they banned me a long time ago one of the mods sent me a...colorful, little message. So yeah good riddance."
So I bought this game impulsivelywould you recommend putting a lot of time in it? i haven't started yet and i'm just trying to find something to take my mind off things and make myself a little happier and this game looks really cool.
"I mean, you're asking on the game's subreddit whether it's worth investing time, you're going to get biased answers. If you've already bought it then you may as well just play it for a bit and decide for yourself whether you enjoy it, if you do then great, play it as long as you're still enjoying it"
"You bought it so just play it lol, what is the worst that can happen?"
Seriously. Who asks if they should play a game after they buy it?
"It is about a 60-hour game for the main stories only, and around 100 hours for all main and sidequests."
"If you dont like JRPGs, you wont like this game. It will require lots of level grinding and equipment hunting and such in order to beat. The plots pretty good, but nothing too out of the park. If youre a fan of music, youll like this game. Octopath soundtrack is one of the best out there. I personally didnt enjoy it at first, but after recruiting more characters and whatnot it started to get a lot more fun."
"I wouldn't say it requires a ton of grinding. As long as you leave evasive maneuvers off and don't actively savescum to avoid encounters, the levels you gain during regular stories are adequate for the chapters. The only time you might need to grind is for endgame content, but it's not a ridiculous amount."
"I put like 100 hours in so I'd say it's a decent investment, especially if you like the battle system and artstyle"
"I'm not trying to be sarcastic here, but why don't you just start playing it and see if you enjoy it? It's a very good game, if you enjoy JRPGs. If you like it I'm sure you'll have a hard time putting it down once you start."
"From an absolutely biased point of view: Yes, you should put time into it. Every characters story is engaging and incredible in all different kinds of ways, so if youre interested in that, its certainly a high point. The music will never leave your head once you hear it for the first time and youll listen to it over and over for so long. The gameplay is super fun, and Ive never had more fun losing to tough bosses on repeat. The game is easily 100+ hours and its worth every single second of it. Im sure itll make you happier, and I really hope this, if not another great game, helps you out!"
"Your opinions on JRPGs may influence how much youll love Octopath, but I think its more telling that you said you wanted to take your mind off things and be happy. This is an excellent good mood game. The characters and visuals set a nice tone and the chapter format keeps a fun pace going. The short story format feels less dense than your average RPG even though you can easily put 100+ hours in as a whole. I spent maybe 5 hours legitimately grinding through my entire playthrough, and I think the game is grindier in reputation than it is in practice. This was one of my favorites from 2018, and Ive always felt it deserves a bigger following so Im quick to recommend it."
"It's a jrpg, which means by default you're going to put a lot of time in it. It's not really a choice lol. I think it's a very good game for both casuals and hardcore rpgers, so you'll likely enjoy it. The battle system and music are both incredible. The story is fairly tropey, but well told enough that you can forgive it. Hope you enjoy the game, and more importantly I hope that whatever is ailing you resolves itself :)"
"Ive been looking for a game for the same reasons you are lately, i compare other games to this game as an ideal candidate"
I tend to have trouble keeping my attention on games for long periods of time unless theyre online / multiplayer. But I played octopath on release for about 90 hours. Did all the side quests and everything. That never happens.

"I might just feel blue from the confinement, but I'm genuinely feeling tired and depressed of the trend off long, highly anticipated games covered in vague or even straight disingenious marketing campaigns appealing to people's emotions/nostalgia to get them to buy something they otherwise would potentially not buy and then seeing the obvious controversy explosion everywhere. It's just tiresome."

Very. The fanbase is currently in shambles apparently
"I decided to Google it. Looks like they added a lot of content and changed the combat system. I think I'll like the new one better, but I can see why people would be upset with this change."
The combat and extra content isn't the issue. It's the plot being changed. Do some more googling. Nomura is pulling some KH3D shit in this.
"It's a sequel, not a remake. I can go on to say more if you wish."

"The 5 pillars that made me full-filledThe 5 Pillars that made me a self made (and self full-filled) man. : When most people hear this they automatically think I mean a girlfriend, fianc or wife. While I think having a partner is important to being happy & full-filled it's not the only important relationship. A solid relationship with family, high quality friends, and even a strong relationship with yourself are extremely important. The dynamics I've create in each of these have been the backbone to my success. Having people I can count on, people I can learn from and people who raise me up. : It took me longer than I'd like to admit to handle this area of my life. I was perfectly content just coasting by with little effort for a few too many years but I decided at some point that I wanted more from myself. My parents didn't work as hard as they did for me to make an average income. Being financially free has allowed me to not only re invest into myself and my business, but also eat where I want, stay where I want, travel where I want and buy what I want. Life isn't only about working hard but also enjoying the fruits of your efforts. : Split into 3 parts: Garbage in = garbage out. I used to love shake shack. If I could have it more than once a week, it would be a no brainer. Problem is I was always tired, slow and lethargic. I would need naps just to get through a day. As soon as I started to care a little more as to what I put in, I had more energy than ever before, and I stopped getting sick. Now? I can't even stomach a shake shack burger even if I tried! Working out and getting in shape. While I'm no bodybuilder, I'm always working to improve my body and take care of myself physically. If I look good, I feel good. Rest. For some reason we've all been sold on the ""KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE"" mentality. We forget how important rest is for the body, for the mind, for ourselves in general. If you don't take some time to rest your body will force you to do so. (I was so overworked last year that I collapsed in an elevator and smashed my head due to this 'keep going no rest' mentality, wasn't fun) : Educating yourself on a continuous basis. Reading books, meditating, learning how to be in control of your emotions when need be (not over reacting) but also being able to express them and experience them when need be. Your mind is capable of more than you give it credit for. If you take care of it, it will take care of you. : Being able to drop your ego and being able to say ""I don't know how to do this, maybe someone can help?"" For a large majority of my life, I held myself back because I was too proud to ask for help. I kept telling myself that I'll figure it out somehow. With that attitude my progress came to a stand still. For years I was lying to myself, till I finally said ok maybe I can use some help. As soon as I did that, every area above accelerated. I had momentum and success in more areas than one and I was able to achieve things I previously could only dream of. Sure I had to invest money to do so, but the trade off vs the results I achieved was a no brainer. There are people out there willing to help you, you just need to reach out and ask. Hope this helps - S (P.S I'm run an awesome facebook group, feel free to join, ask questions or even give value to the other members https://www.facebook.com/groups/moaforum )"
Could you be elaborate on how you became more financially independent?
"1. Start with a good monthly/yearly budget and understanding of your spendings/incomes. Use a spreadsheet. 2. Create a plan on how much you need to support the lifestyle your want including hobbies, travels, etc... 3. Make sure you make a bit of money every month that you can put on the side. Stop spending money on useless shit. 4. With that money left, pay your bad debts if you have any. 5. Create a security fund and retirement fund. The COVID situation give you the perfect example on why you need a security fund. 6. Invest everything else in secure, long-term positions, that creates cash flow. 7. Track all that, consistently, in your budget/plan spreadsheet. Beside, work on your multipliers, your knowledge, skills, how to bring more value to the table. That's it. Simple but not easy and it takes time and energy. But nobody is going to do it for you."
"Smart and concise, I like it. Thanks for the info."
">till I finally said ok maybe I can use some help. As soon as I did that, every area above accelerated. I'd recommend checking out r/personalfinace. Some great basic information."
Can you explain a bit more about the 6th point. I'm still in college and no nothing about investments yet but I've heard many people talk about it whenever financial freedom is the topic. Thank you
"This topic is vast. Document yourself on stock dividends, fund, ETF, crowdfunding, crowdestate, etc... Or buy an apartment and rent it. The idea is to be comfortable with what you do. You are not a broker so forget about playing on the stock market. Invest long term, with stable, recurrent income."
Alright thanks :)
I would disagree with the covid 19 part because in events of economic collapse the finance you saved could potentially be worth nothing which means it might be better to invest in something more physical not necessarily gold but that's one thing
"I'd argue that a saving account in a big bank is secure enough. Banks rarely collapse, even though it's true that this can happen."
"There are some books that I can recommend to you, if you are interested in how to handle this essential pillar of your life. So books that tremendously helped me (since I come from a working class family and my parents didn't teach me shit about finances let alone stocks and the like): Rich Dad Poor Dad, Money by Tony Robbins. The latter one has Tonys usual Pathos in it, so if you don't like it, go find another book. All the knowledge is out there and does not cost you much but gives you so much leverage when talking to your bank guy... hard part is only to find the right books."
You don't need money to get decent women.
And you don't need women to have a decent life.

Combatsystem compairWith what game does the combatsystem compair with?
"In a very basic sense, it can compare with a game like Dark Souls 3, though not nearly as intricate or punishing. I don't mean this in a bad sense, just that the combat is not the point of the game like it is in a game like Dark Souls."
More like bloodborne.
"I will take your word for it, I haven't played bloodborne."
Its dark souls without the shields.
Then that makes sense I agree with this lol

I feel like there's a similarity when compared to the combat system in Final Fantasy XV.

I didn't expect something different from people who harass lonely people in the internet. Atleast we destroyed their mothership and lift the moral in our group. We have to infiltrate their evasion sub and destroy them from the inside.

What brought on the sudden change in the way reddit handles these type of subs? Usually they were all in favor of subs that attack men. I suspect that FDS is next in the firing line.

What's up with these guys believing sperm changes a woman's dna and psychologically
They want to believe theyre worth something
I think there was one study about the dna of a womans son being retained inside her body or something? Dont quote me on that but maybe thats what the refer to. Either way its bull
I wonder if a woman is still psycho if shes with a large number of men (in their opinion) and they use condoms every time so no sperm enters into her body? Or does it change the DNA some other way that would work with their narrative instead in that case?

"Mother's ex believes I'm partly related to him because he slept with her 13 years before I was bornSo I don't know if this belongs in this sub, but I thought I'd share because I find this hilarious. My mother's ex tried to ""educate"" me on how I'm partly related to him and share my DNA with him because 13 years before I was conceived he was intimate with my mother and his semen had apparently survived 13 years of menstrual (and sexual) activity, and somehow lived inside her uterus for over a decade, and then partially impregnated her when I was conceived. I can't pretend to understand his thought process, but he was dead serious in thinking that his own sperm could survive in a uterus for over a decade"

The age doesnt matter. The important part is that the ex had sex with OPs mother over a decade before OPs birth and presumably not since then.
A disappointing amount of people think semen lives in a woman forever and that it can even alter her DNA
These same people shouldnt be passing on their DNA.
I am sure they don't.

Why are you interacting with your mother's ex?
"Is there any special way of eye contact?Hi everyone, after i learned pick-up and seduction , first thing that I added to my game was holding eye contact. I dont break eye contact about %90 of the times until other person breaks it . I only break it if i try to remember something. After like 3 months, I started to realise that sometimes people scare that im holding eye contact and in that moments I felt creepy . Idk maybe i misinterpreted their body language maybe they were not scared but still sometimes that happens and I feel creepy occasionally if that happens. I want to ask that if there is anyone felt in a same way before or is it just me that being delusional? Also is there any gesture or special way of eye contact or something that I can do during conversation to prevent this being creepy vibe? Thanks for the opinions."
"During the prolonged eye contact, what are you thinking? And what are you feeling? Your facial expression is important when holding eye contact, and a lot of us may not be aware of what our face is doing! Be careful that you dont appear too intense... or look like youre looking for a fight! If during extended eye contact, you are thinking positive thoughts about yourself and the other person and the moment youre in, this can help your facial expression, physiology (e.g. how slow and relaxed your eye blinking is) and your eye contact seem warm, welcoming, and relaxed."
It really all comes down to whether you are attractive or not. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viDyLJyonIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viDyLJyonIk)
"In everything in game, besides holding frame, even in which in rare times it must be broken for comfort reasons, you must utilize it as push pull. Eye contact is to create tension, to project energy, mindset, focus. In pick up we use what we call laser eye contact. 1. Forehead relaxed 2. Eyes low like someone shined a light in it, or you just woke up 3. Barely able to tell that your eyes are open, but enough to know you definitely are alive 4. Focused on a singular point. A point within that point. Like staring at the eye of a needle. Then trying to find the middle of the eye of that needle. That's what makes it laser 5. You project what you're thinking in your mind through your eyes. If you feel it genuinely, your eyes will assume it 5a. Relaxed, yet loose and solid. Like how you lightly pull a rubberband apart and when you snap it it returns to position. It didn't have to do anything to do that. It simply was. Strong eye contact implies many things. Dominance. Confidence. Ability to be present in the moment and be relaxed. Lack of fear. But it can also project the desire to be violent. A predator never takes its eyes off its prey. You however know she is not prey. You hold eye contact just long enough to communicate the right things, then break it. Like you break for natural pauses in conversation. Push pull. Good feelings, then take it away. The tension comes from them wondering and wanting the good feelings back. There isn't a magic formula for when to pull back. You have to feel your way into it and be empathetic."
Maybe make less eye contact? Eye contact is fine until it turns into a staring match that you feel trapped in.
Must wear Binoculars on top of goggles on top of sunglasses on top of prescription glasses
If you feel creepy break it. If it feels mutual don't break it.
"Mirroring the other persons intensity of eye contact is pro-social. Too much eye contact when they arent doing it is read as intimidating and puts the other person on defense. Too little when theyre doing more than you and its read as anxious and low self-esteem. Mirror the other person in all social signaling and youll be golden (I.e. crossing legs, leaning in or leaning back, smiling, etc)"
"Do you give them an intense look? Like run for your life or else you are dead look? Make sure you study your facial expressions next time when you hold an eye contact. Portray a friendly look. Smile a bit. Smile, don't smirk. Give them a little brow lift."
supposedly most humans naturally break eye contact every 3 seconds or so in order to not appear threatening so thats probably why it appears creepy
"When youre trying to maintain prolonged eye contact, take time to notice the persons eye color. Really get in there, look at the different shades. For whatever reason, this always reads as warm and intimate eye contact. In my experience people respond very positively to it."
"As long as the look is light, and then give an ever so slight side smile, that's says ""just admiring your beauty"". Not a look that is intense and just says ""I wanna fuck you""."
"Holding unnatural eye contact IS creepy. Honestly when people do that to me I stop talking bc it's distracting. If a person chimes in with a noise of understanding (yup, uh huh, I see etc...) way too much ill stop talking as well bc it feels rushed and fake. Stop trying and just do. People pick up on things like trying too hard so try less at what you're doing and trust yourself more to naturally be engaged in a conversation."
"Try standing side by side. It's nature for men to be side by side more with friend than foe, see? And it's also very common for introverts or people with adhd symptoms to listen better when not holding eye contact with someone. Other than that, practice. Saying that you've only been practising eye contact for three months, though; Why not your whole life? Maybe now you're just paying attention to it and over thinking? Trust your instincts and relax"
Make sure to blink
"Dude I've been coming in this sub and other dating related subs for the last two days. I'm starting fights with everyone in every thread. This place is now officially toxic, abandon ship"
"What you're saying is brutally honest, but I wish you would have added more detail on why guys are wasting their time entertaining girls that can't/won't meet up right now. This time should be used to improve ourselves and stay in contact with the people we truly care about. When this is all done dating won't be a main priority for most girls. Guys that want to meet girls at this time have their priorities out of wack. It's a sad fact."
"Lol this is the most honest and realistic post Ive ever seen here. Man, take my upvote and thumbs up and whatever. You speak the truth people need to accept."
"Thanks man, the truth stings!"
I'm working on a master level field report on how to get girls out during covid 19. It'll clear up all this mess.
"Texting and facetiming is more for practice during quarantine than as a way to set up dates in the future. During quarantine you have the choice of (a) self improvement and practice, (b) trying to date girls as safely as possible, or (c) crawling under a rock. You do not have the choice (d) getting on reddit and whining and cursing about what other people choose to do."
"I wouldn't even call it practice, right now it's the only way to socialize with people. I agree with OP that setting up dates right now is a fool's errand. However, girls do really appreciate someone who is able to talk and have fun with them through the phone, facetime or whatever. So maybe we shouldn't focus on setting up dates but just generally being a fun guy to be around and talk in these times."
"Bruh, chill out. We get it, you are alone, don't yell at the world because of it."
"Even the article on slate called men out for being so eager during this. Women want to be left alone when they grocery shop, not have it be turned into a pick up environment. This whole COVID thing is lifting the veil on how desperate and lonely a large potion of the male population is here in the states."
"So true, my god."
"I disagree. It's good practice, and if you have multiple girls lined up, there is a good chance that one of them will meet up with you after the quarantine. You are right that there is no guarantee that a girl will meet up with you afterwards; however, life doesn't give you any guarantees though. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't put your best foot forward and try though. Also, you are spreading misinformation. It is most likely not going to be like this for 12-18 months. China is already easing up restrictions which took them around 3 months."
"Sure, you could line up multiple girls and hope one works out. Unrealistic with the current circumstances, but maybe possible. Also, I'm not spreading misinformation.

"A guy asked me if women fart every 5-15 minutes when ovulating.His logic? Because sex on average lasts about 5-15 minutes. I tried to get him to elaborate on his logic, and all he said was basically that if women fart every 5-15 minutes its her bodys way of only farting 0-1x during sex, which would still be acceptable. So what he was asking was if women fart periodically every 5-15 minutes during ovulation so it would be acceptable if the ovulating woman was to have sex. According to him all he knows about ovulation is women are more likely to get pregnant and they are gassy. Edit: I should elaborate, I agree with him about women possibly having stomach issues when ovulating, thats what I was discussing with my friends when he interrupted. Its the perfectly timed farting that makes no sense."

Right???? I asked him to explain many times but Im still so confused
"Tell him it all depends on what the last guy whose cum she swallowed had for lunch that day. If it was pineapple, she'll fart less than if it was chili. And then back off verrrrry carefully and close the door on your way out ;)"
Id love to but I feel like he would actually believe it..... :D
"At least he'll go on a healthy diet, i guess"
"I'm more concerned that he never went through sex ed. It always baffles me when schools don't teach the basics. We had it in our school in fifth grade and it made everything very clear and normal even if there was a lot of giggling. Poor guy, at least he asked though."
"I'm most concerned that he thinks sex lasts 5-15 minutes, and that that's the amount of time our bodies are made for."
"It does for him, clearly"
"That and the idea that our bodies are made to not fart during sex, so as to not become.. ""unacceptable"" like, idk about y'all but my body has never seemed to care :X"
He knows 2 things about ovulation. 1 + 1 = -73
I've totally farted during sex. Was it acceptable? Idk but my husband laughed and kept going. Every 5-15 minutes is a lot of farts. I can't even understand this thought line
I just can't- that's the only thing I wanna say here

Hell yeah
That's pretty cool. Big fan of Comic Tropes and Matt Draper specifically.
"Today Was a Bad Day, and I'm Glad It WasJust want to share a young fella's small epiphany. As simple as it is, it will help me stay on track in the times we're living in. **Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place.** Today was the first day of this pandemic that I felt like it wasn't going to be easy. In the rare occasions I feel down I tend to think ""Welp that's it, I feel like shit and I have no control over the situation so I guess I'll just feel shit until I don't."" I know, fkn helpful huh. Thankfully I've been working on this and a lot more. So after a long day of things just not going my way and my overall state of mind not helping I recognised it was time for a good ol' meditation. I have found that taking a breather can go a long way. So there I am all zen and shit when I allow my mind to wander a little so I can figure my shit out. I asked myself what might be one of the oldest questions: Why am I not happy right now? Well idk I've been taking care of myself. A couple weeks ago I started taking workouts far more seriously (thanks TRP) and doing some yoga too. But hmm now that I think about it such a change in lifestyle can temporarily make you feel drained of energy. I have also been eating well than before BUT HMM now that I think about it I skipped a few meals in the last couple days. And I did (make a conscious decision to) relapse from NoFap today. And yadayadayada Huh, it makes a whole lotta sense my brain isn't giving me happy chemicals, even tho just a few days ago I was thriving in almost the same routine. I've been on autopilot, haven't I? So I considered all my past experiences on this contentment subject and looked for the exact things I haven't been doing. Surprise surprise, it was nothing I didn't already know subconsciously. And yet I had it so perfectly laid out in front of me that I wrote it down and stuck it in the window in front of my desk. Call it a dogma for contentment: &#x200B; >**Only by letting go of vices, practicing good habits, and looking after our mind and body,** > >**we can expect to appreciate life and know what we need** &#x200B; ""But a disciplined life without dopamine seems so boring!"" You'll be surprised to find how fulfilling it becomes. Not only it's far easier to find contentment, but you also know what you want in order to be happy. More specifically, you are more aware of what your body and brain need in order to stay tf out of your way. Let me break down my experience: 1. **Let go of vices** \- I was doing NoFap and getting laid consistently so I had to make a smooth transition. Space out masturbation and don't fall into porn. Weed (which is everywhere in my social circles) also tends to make me lazy and can get me down. Social media, youtube videos with no valuable content yadayada. 2. **Good habits and looking after yourself** \- Exercise, yoga, meditation, staying in touch with people, watching a few sunsets and adding variety to the day through a hobby. 3. **Appreciate Life** \- The day goes by faster, you enjoy the simple things, you feel fulfilled and in the right course. 4. **Know what you need** \- By going off autopilot and cultivating mindfulness you don't fall back into old habits and you notice what you need as soon as that need arises. Thank you for reading. Honestly, I wrote this more for myself. My state of mind can be quite volatile, which probably isn't the case for most fellas. But I hope it helps someone. Also if there's any grammar mistakes or incongruencies: English ain't my first language. Stay safe, make the most out of the present moment."

Youre doing a fine job. This was well-written and informative. Good work and not just on this write up.
"our daily habits define us, years go by and it really fucking shows. I stopped consuming caffeine since ive been hard abusing preworkout/adderal pushing 2 years. it really helps me maximize my workouts so i can consistently achieve exhaustion versus fatigue. Not always adderal but always preworkout. caffeine break going on 3 weeks, workouts from home suck without much equipment. just ordered those weighted bands, should be able to get some real soreness back in my life. I'd still rather exercise with and around others, its enjoyable but i'll just appreciate it that much more when i can finally return"
How is the caffeine break going? Been thinking of trying one
"Caffeine is a drug like any other king, youll see withdrawal and improvements."
"Good vibes dude, I'm just getting out of depressive funk too. Gyms closed? Fuck it, I'm a long distance runner now. Can't date? Fuck it, I'm potentially saving lives by social distancing and getting time to reflect on life. Figuring out my new routines, exploring some creative interests and starting to thrive a bit now. You can't control the bad shit that comes your way in life but you can certainly control your response."
"This 'pandemic' and isolation is going to effect us all in different ways. For myself, I can't do some of the usual routines which sort my shit out. The drive to the gym, being around others, meditations between sets. Gone. Some of my goals and purpose at work. Stunted. Lock-down, survival, adaptation mode is tough. Not a lot of journey pleasure. The fact you are taking some responsibility and meditating is huge. Eventually this will all pass. There will be two kinds of people. Those who fell into fear, angst, anxiety and went crazy. And those who struggled, adapted and proved to themselves they can withstand and withhold."
"Absolutely! I used to wake up at 4:45am get workout and tea and other jazz in before driving 30 minutes to school, now my school is in my room and I'm jumbled up! I guess my discipline isn't strong enough but tbh I needed the leaving my house stimulus."
"Yeah, it's a bitch. We just have to adapt and try different things. I've gotten a set of resistance tubes to workout with. Really like them. Doing more guided meditations. More reflections/journaling. Lucky I still work, so that's a huge bonus. Bitch of a time, but a chance to get back to basics."
"Exactly the same thing I just started, yesterday. Hopefully I can continue. Journaling and the guided meditations!! WISHING you all the best"
"Yeah, good luck. Good chance to read, too."
"Well written, not sucking your own dick, honest, basically helpful reminder. Good post"
> Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place You are so cynical. You don't know how world works.
"This is good information. Its important to adapt to our environment and realize that we cannot control every situation. We control what we can and change our life accordingly. People neglect the time were given in this pandemic and just laze of all day. If you have lots of spare time on your hands you might as well spend it being productive or meditating. Introspection, Isolation, and improvement are key during this time."
"Outside their prime age, the situation does not look good for women ...This is the ""complaint"" video about mature women not being able to find a man: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeSuTAM-ToE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeSuTAM-ToE) It says: *How do we not lose hope in finding love? How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \[rich, famous\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.* In the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30): *Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.* *Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.* *It has been 20 years since my divorce. I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months. Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic. I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend ""with benefits"" . I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens. I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.* *Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time. But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.* *Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?* I think that the lesson for women is quite simple. Either they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation. Of course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really)."

"""So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it."" I would give some credit to #4 for at least being honest and admitting she is at fault. I hope she didn't tell the last guys about the first 15. ""Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?"" Delusional high ncount nut job. Single but ""heaps of men"" I'm speachless."
"Yeah, she even admits to her early-20s her ride on the carousel! ;-)"
Is she single?
"she (and others like her) has no clue that any guy worth anything gets grossed out when she says how many guys shes been with, and just lowers her to a quick fuck once a month. then she says hes emotionally distant or whatever, but hes just not interested. if i was a woman i would just hide my n count like my life depends on it. it sucks but thats how it is"
"They could at least teach younger generations to avoid their faults (the having ""fun"" in early 20s part) and instead start vetting men.. I don't think they will though!"
"It's being alone that they fear. It's having to care for themselves that they fear. Love has nothing to do with it. We as men de-prioritize intimate relationships, so it's not in the forefront like it is with women. Plus we can take care of ourselvses. And of course if you're high value, even as older men there's always that 70 year old we can bang."
I mean if only the 30 yr old lowered her standards a bit she would find hordes of men who want a relationship. And possibly even the 35yr old one. What was the 70yr old thinking when she divorced at 50 though?
"True, I would say what he describes can only last if she is not on social media."
"Its a good thing or bad thing depending on what you're looking for tbh, ie. Plating or LTR >shes afraid shell never meet someone else as good as me. This you gotta be careful about, don't take her words too literally, as women can say one thing, and say something totally different the next day."
"Just know her emotions and opinions of you can change at anytime. She might feel this way for a different guy every 2 weeks. Not trying to kill your vibe. It definitely a good thing, but just be careful"
"Good thing, but AWALT. Can be a red flag, but it is generally a green flag."
"Generally it's a good thing but you gotta watch out is it a: ""I'm so insecure that I'm afraid you will leave me"" or is it a ""I did something wrong and now I'm afraid you'll find out and leave me."
It means your SMV is way higher than hers. It's bad for you because you're settling with someone who is likely pretty unattractive. Do better.
"tread lightly, watch her actions not her words."
"People don't want to admit they are wrong, /r/TwoXChromosomes is the worst sub in this regard, many posts still up painting him as the abuser but none up with the truth"
"That's a definite fact. And I'd expect nothing less of 2X. However as this is a debate sub, I have higher expectations of the people here. Especially the feminists considering this particular situation. In addition this situation highlights the real affect modern feminism has had on gender equality. In this situation, we have identified a victim of years long abuse, one where the perp has manipulated society at large and even spoke at the women's march. And now that the truth has come to light, feminism and the media are silent. And it's because it provides evidence of the fallacy of feminism and is an example of all the criticisms of the MRM/Anti Fem movement. And that can't be abided. Also to the people who make the argument ""Feminism isn't that powerful of a movement"" uhhh an almost complete media blackout on the TRUTH would suggest otherwise. Damn even Andrew Yang didn't get done this dirty."
"If the media is silent, how do we all know about what's going on?"
"There are people on YouTube talking about it and such, the ongoing coverage of the progression of proceedings against Amber Heard generally isn't being... Heard, by the major news networks."
^^^ This.
"Huh I hadn't realized this sub hadn't discussed it at all, that surprised me especially since everyone here doubted it in the first place"
"Not speaking for anyone other than myself here I've seen plenty of articles and discussions about it, but don't bring it up here, or even participate in discussions elsewhere, because there doesn't seem to be much constructive to say about it. I'm glad that there is some visibility into it, but much of what I see just looks like so much gloating and 'I told you so', and it just doesn't strike me as constructive."
I've seen some very limited discussions about it in the media. But not anywhere near what is warranted. Especially considering how much the story blew up when it was just Heard's fabricated version.
"I mean, I saw lots of discussion, but it was mostly on my facebook wall. And most of that discussion boiled down to ""holy shit Amber Heard is scum, Depp has been through hell"". I definitely heard more about it when the truth came out than earlier... I barely heard the initial claim until it was already being debunked."

"One thing you have to know is that there is a fundamental flaw in this question - ""What do women want?"" The flaw is this -- Every single man who ever asked this question is operating in a woman's frame, with her as the goddess whom he's trying to learn to please. And as we know, women don't have much of a frame at all. That is the source of the confusion. As for the much more useful question ""Who am I, the man?"", it never occurs to the average man to ask himself that, let alone answer it. His self awareness is limited to the knowledge that he's got a dick that has begun to work for more than just pissing, that his heart rate is a little higher and maybe his navel's tingling. I doubt if the thought even arose that yes, he is indeed a man... Which doesn't help him have a frame of a man in the least, let alone a life worthy of a man. It takes men a long way down the road to realize that even if they are doing everything else right, they are still not operating in their frame yet, but trying to find hers. That is more subtle stuff, not as easy to spot as skin and bones or a pot belly, or that you don't even know how to talk to a girl -- but it's the root of the problem. It takes even more experience to learn all the ways in which we're still subconsciously doing it. If you have properly gone through the trp factory, when you come out the other end, you should have an honest answer to ""Who am I as a man?"" and ""What kind of woman do I want? "" And even then, growth and learning never end even for the best of us. We just learn to find out own way and make our own contribution from there."
"A good part of this post reads as: Rule 1: Be attractive. Rule 2: Don't be unattractive. And then there's bits and pieces of other TRP posts lumped in at the end, like ""stop being a pussy and take action""."
"And the entirety of this comment is completely idiotic and meaningless. But if you're really strong, then we're looking forward to your post."
"Not really sure why I should have to post something to validate my criticism of your post. Something that gets told quite frequently around here is ""read more"" and that's for a good reason. And if you want to dismiss my comment by calling it idiotic and meaningless, that's fine by me man. Didn't think it would hurt your feelings that much."
Yet another virtual slap in the face. thanks dude
Does having baby face make your face look less masculine? It has to right?
"So, what if you're into military type men?I grew up in rural place where men know how to shoot and hunt from early. Everyone owns a rifle. Most men are also very handy. They could all be on Discovery's ""Dirty job"". Military service is mandatory and all men have done it. I'm also from a place that has had a civil war so older men 45+ have had some participation in it. War stories around the fire camp where common as a little girl. This is where I need your advice. I have a huge thing for military type guys since puberty. Like huge. It isn't a ""just the uniform"" thing but it's just a important attraction factor for me. Do you guys have any advice on how to go about this? I feel a lot of shame. Like oh I'm ""that"" kind of a woman. edit: I also want to add that I'm 29 (sigh). I'm interested in american military men. thanks for the gold stranger."
"Nothing wrong with having a type. From what you describe it seems like you are into the qualities that military type men can offer. Handy, knowledgeable, independent and capable. All very attractive qualities. All I would say is dont glorify them though, they arent all the same and just because theyve been military doesnt automatically mean they have the above qualities. And also they come with their own set of problems and you need to be aware of this. And you also need to get properly. I like baldies and my friends make fun of me but Id still date a dude with hair."
">> All very attractive qualities. All I would say is dont glorify them though, they arent all the same and just because theyve been military doesnt automatically mean they have the above qualities Very well put"
I'm surprised by seeing this level of maturity on the internet. Especially on Reddit. This subreddit gives me hope in finding my SO. Bless this subreddit
Any tips for vetting military guys?
"A lot of women aren't up for the military wife life, because they're basing it on romanticized representations from novels and Army Wives reruns. It doesn't seem like that will be a problem for you. You appear to understand the demands of marrying a solider and plenty of them need that. I say go for it. Find yourself a military man and be his rock."
"Make a few friends with some veterans - after Afghanistan and Iraq, theres a lot of men 25-40 that are veterans. Theres a major difference between listening to war stories around a fire, and being the emotional support for someone who has emotional trauma from combat. Im not saying that ALL veterans have major emotional trauma, but a lot do, and regardless, having combat experience will most certainly augment your world view in some way. My dad is a combat veteran with drastic and life altering emotional trauma, and a lot of my friends have varying levels of these types of feelings from Iraq and Afghanistan, and I know it was (and is) extremely difficult for me to be the person my dad depended on. Also, do understand the overall stereotypes and feelings that most military men have and propagate about women who are into military guys. You will need to be prepared to be subject to a lot of negativity from men who will say you are there for the benefits and the money. If you need to know where to start, try looking up the word dependa. TL:DR Im not here to say you shouldnt ever date military men, but I just want you to have a realistic idea of that means."
"As someone in the military, I'd really recommend you do a lot of research about being a potential military wife. My wife and I have been through some pretty significant hardships that wouldn't have happened if I weren't in the service. There are some positive sides to it of course, but the negatives can outweigh those by a significant amount at times. For example, I now have a type of anxiety that I can't control thanks to things that have happened in the last few months. My wife is doing a fantastic job being there for me emotionally, but this is far and away not normal for, I would imagine, most marriages. I'm not trying to discourage you by any means, but it's well worth considering what type of relationship you're getting into."
"To piggyback off this, you MUST be very independent. My husband and I have been separated for up to 18 months at a time. So if you dont have a full satisfying life outside of your marriage, and a strong support system you can be miserable."
"Hazarding a guess here - youre from a former Balkan nation? Just wondering, because although many folks reading this will have some experience/understanding of what being a US military wife is like, the former Yugoslavian civil war was.... something pretty different even from active service in Iraq. I dont need to tell you to vet carefully."
"About the double standards of Reddit (the ""what if we reversed the genders"" case)I'm mostly targetting the AITA and relationsip\_advice subreddits, there are many time where people say ""Just reverse the genders and people would react very differently"". I agree with these claims several time, and it's very likely that there is an ""empathy"" gap where women get support or understanding and men don't. For example : [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5xt2c/my_girlfriend_wont_let_me_finish_in_her_mouth/) is about a guy whose GF won't give him a blowjob (or won't let him finish in her mouth, the post is unclear) and almost everybody just tell him to deal with it and stop wanting it. While at the same time [another posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5vcda/nsfw_my_boyfriend_absolutely_will_not_go_down_on/) about a girl whose BF won't go down on her get responses telling her to dump the dude. I've also seen two AITA posts about a parent wanting nothing to do with their born child because they didn't want it when the pregnancy happened but the pregnancy was carried anyway: You guessed it, the woman had tons of NTA saying she's not forced to get involved in the child's life. And the man got almost unanimously YTA saying that if he has sex he should be ready to be a father.(I wanted to put the posts but unfortunately one of them have been deleted and the second post's link was in the comments of the first) I'm pretty sure that it has been discussed a lot, with many examples, do you have other links and examples ? Has anybody made or is interested in making the experiment (like posting at different times two situations that are exactly the same except the genders are swapped) ?"

This whataboutism is one of the reasons why my empathy for men dropped as low as it did and I'm noticing more women reacting similarly across Reddit. Men don't make good arguments anymore. They just try to undermine women on Reddit at every turn and cry victim.
But how do you reasonably justify the differences here?
"Dont blame men for your lack of empathy when there wasnt much to begin with. And in terms of whining and entitlement, white women have the olympic gold on that despite being the most privileged demo in the history of man."
"""Switch the gender and think again"" kind of arguments are not whataboutism. They are an argument that tries to appeal to the idea that since all people are equal then all people should be judged by the same standard. That can be accomplished by judging women the same way that we judge men (that could be called undermining women if we try hard enough) or by judging men in the same way we judge women. In any case. What would be the wrong thing with using the same standard for all people?"
"OP: What do you guys think gay-footed unicorns that fart in purple? DangZagnut: >Thats why #BelieveWomen is such bullshit. >Believe no women. All women lie about everything. All women abandon their children. All women are pedophiles. All women are rapists. All women cannot be trusted not relied on in any situation. >Make those be the default assumptions at all the times because theres been a lifetime of pussy worshipping and historical abuse. Ie: Emmett Till. >Always assume the woman is is the perpetrator every, single, time. Thats your operator setting. >Because they usually are, but hiding behind a pussy protection shield. Pussy pass isnt made up in peoples heads. The question doesn't even matter with you anymore, does it. Look at me, a lying woman here to abuse you! Ooga booga!"
"In your first set of examples, the guy was getting blowjobs and just couldnt finish in her mouth, while the girl wasnt getting anything at all. Also, there were a grand total of 2 comments telling her to dump him. In your second examples, I cant see the posts obviously, but without a bit more context its hard to tell the situation youre describing. From having browsed AITA, its _usually_ guys walking out on the kid and the mother entirely; when women walk out on the baby they usually put it up for adoption. Maybe your example was different, what do I know, but Id expect putting a kid up for adoption to be interpreted way more positively than leaving the kid and their other parent. Edit: also, read the girls post history lmao. Her previous post was literally a rant about how she wanted to break up with her boyfriend and was excited that him moving away would give her an excuse to do so... yeah, Id tell her to just let him off now, too."
"TRP Perpetuates ""hypergamy"" on its ownJust found this sub, so I hope it's ok to post this here, but I just wanted to offer a perspective for discussion that's been bothering me: I'm a woman who's been fortunate to find success in her career, so I end up having a significantly higher income than a lot of men I meet. This isn't something that really concerns me. The way I see it, if we get married, my money becomes *our* money so it doesn't matter in the end as long as my partner can support himself and shares my financial values. However, what I discovered over and over again in the dating pool was that men themselves seemed to have more of an issue with it than I did. What was most hurtful was when I would begin seriously dating someone only to discover they felt insecure and resentful about it further down the road. They didn't like their girlfriend picking up the tab for things. They felt stupid waiting for me at home while I worked long hours. They didn't want to play ""second fiddle"" to their girlfriend as they saw it and have my career be the one dictating our living situation. These things hurt their pride and made them feel emasculated. I don't believe every man is like this. But isn't this how TRP would have men act? The brand of destructive masculinity TRP touts would have you believe that all these things ARE inherently emasculating and negative. Would they allow their girlfriend or wife to have a career that comes up against theirs or be the primary breadwinner in their household? My sense is no. So what is the end result here? If that's the case, I'm effectively forced into giving up my lucrative career at my partner's behest, or only dating men who equally or more successful than I am who won't feel threatened by me. So wouldn't RP ideology force me into ""hypergamy"" on its own?"
"Dated several women who made more money than me. Moved in with one. She used to say the same horse shit your saying. Til its time to split the bills, or you gotta actually pay for stuff. Sorry, not buying it. Been thru this several times in life. Once you want to go on vacations and go out to eat and expect gifts and dude cant keep up with you i promise youll dry up fast and start to resent him. idc what anyone says."
"Well, I dont know your situation, but I picked up more than half or all a lot of times because it made financial sense and I was happy to do it. Like my post stated, I wasnt the one with the problem. I paid for entire vacations because it was in my budget. Sounds like you may be attracting more traditional women."
"Well i make $65,000 a year in ohio with overtime. If you make more than me hit me up we can date. But only if you make more haha."
"Im in the six figure range, but I live nowhere near Ohio."
Sorry honey. I got roots here and a decent career. Im cemented. But best of luck to ya! Hmu if you come out this way you can absolutely pay the tab when i take you out!
Interesting perspective. Sounds like this guy is very insecure. Some men are like that but I'm not convinced it has anything to do with TRP.
"I obviously havent dug too deep into it, but isnt TRP a proponent of traditional relationship dynamics with the man being the dominant decision-maker and provider?"
"Then you obviously don't know TRP. TRPers are discouraged into entering LTR's or marriages and instead have casual relationships with multiple women. I don't agree with everything on TRP but the ""spinning plates"" strategy is great for modern men and better than a traditional relationship"
Then why is hypergamy even a concern for them?
How do you feel about a man interjecting when he thinks another man is displaying inappropriate behaviour to woman?I sometimes see things happening but feel uncomfortable interjecting because I might be wrong or make things worse. Women laugh when a guy says something in appropriate. Sometimes it's because they don't want to piss him but other times they might laugh because they do find it funny. How do I know which is which? What of the woman just wants to ride it out and by interjecting I prolong it inadvertently? I never know what to do.
"Use your judgment. Rushing in to help isn't always the best answer. If someone looks distressed and unable to respond, you saying something might be very helpful. If someone looks like they're in control, maybe they don't want to see the thing blow up. If she's laughing it can be hard to judge whether it's tactical laughter or nervous or genuine. Just read the room as best you can. Also before you say something, check how confident you are that can make your point then disengage instead of getting dragged into a battle of wills. It's sad but lots of times when men argue over something a woman will always get blamed in the end and will suffer the long term consequences. Women are historical scapegoats for lots of the world's problems."
"what /u/snarkerposey11 said, use your judgement. especially if you don't really know what a woman might think or experience in the situation, think about what you would do if you saw someone starting to be inappropriate, rude, maybe predatory with a *man*, and try to adapt that to the situation. you can even think about what you might do if a person was being inappropriate with you but you were afraid to be openly confrontational with them. you can give signals to tell the person they are being inappropriate without ""swooping in"" and possibly making things take a worse turn. maybe it won't always work, but don't underestimate how much a person's behaviour can change when they know other men are paying attention and judging them."
Ask her. Offer her to join you and your friends if she feels uncomfortable. She then knows that someones registered the situation (and might have her gut feeling evaluated) and she has an escape route if she needs ohne. She can also not use it if it isnt needed. She has options now
"Intervene. Too many bystanders just let things happen. When women laugh at inappropriate behaviour, usually its nervous laughter or shock because we dont know how to react. Its not that we find it funny."
I would interject. When people encounter any conflict they often consider the person who brought it up the person who caused it. When you bring it up itll make you be seen as the cause of the drama for bringing it up shielding the victim of the behaviour from backlash for defending herself. As a man youll likely receive less backlash for speaking up.
"Everyone is different and every situation is different. I personally think its nice to get some backup from men, if Im experiencing sexism (especially in the workplace). Simple things like Woah, thats not cool or Wait, dont interrupt her, let her finish or Isnt that the same idea she suggested 20 minutes ago? are much appreciated!"
I think this is a great example of how to be supportive! I would appreciate this in a work place as well!
"I think there is a difference between defending one person, and calling someone out on their behaviour. The first can be a great thing if the person feels threatened, if they feel they can't do it themselves, but can also make them feel inadequate or draw attention they don't want. I would recommend not a focus on the person it is being done to, but focus on the person doing the bad behaviour and call it out. Try to deescalate. ""Not cool bro"" or similar."
"I think that 99% of people who you stand up for will appreciate it that any 3rd party stood up for them. But you may get a different answer when looking at it from a feminist perspective, because when you think of the bigger picture to womens equality, its just a man listening to another man. I dont think that should hold you back from speaking up for what you believe is right, however. Its at least a first step. And like I said, 99% of the time, it will go much more appreciated than not saying anything at all."
"Self improvement resources for being a better/warmer conversationalist and for regulating emotionsI couldnt find this specifically through the search functions. Anyone here has book recommendations or practical applications on how to improve conversation skills in RPW context (I feel like conversing as a businesswoman is very different) and on how to regulate emotions? Struggling with these two aspects a lot - its the last two things on my list to work on for my current self improvement journey. For conversation, I struggle with putting on a social mask, so to speak. Social niceties and sounding open/warm drain me a lot, because my character tends to be more calm, straightforward and logical, even serious. When Im not mentally prepared to make small talk, sometimes I get nervous and dont know how to reply, unless there is a point to the conversation (eg. we are meeting to discuss X, for example) or it is a genuinely interesting discussion without the social niceties filter. I worry sometimes that I may be good for stimulating discussions, but may not be warm/affirmative enough. How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? (I do feel warm and open to listening, Im just not sure that Im coming off that way!). I also have a very low threshold for bullshit, and many times conversations seem to involve white lies, feigned interest, bullshitting, which make it tiring. Is this a perspective problem that I have or is this something everyone just does out of practice? This area in life has confused me so much. I would rather I have a more natural strategy too because I dont think I can keep up an act for the rest of my life. My MBTI is INTJ because it may explain some things. My goal = be a better *female* friend to my female friends (not just a *masculine* friend), and a soft place to land for my future partner Also struggling with regulating my emotions, I tend to change moods very quickly and dwell on the past/future a lot, and although there are no major mental health concerns, I would like to feel more stable/in tune and in control of my emotions. Stronger. I cant go to therapy at the moment because I pumped my money into fitness/feminine goals. Can anyone recommend some books? Any other self improvement suggestions for soft skills also very much welcome. Hope everyone is safe and healthy in this climate!"
"> I worry sometimes that I may be good for stimulating discussions, but may not be warm/affirmative enough. How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? Shift your focus from abstract ideas to placating to people. When you're talking to someone, always think about their emotions first more than whatever it is you're trying to convey. I think that'll do it. I'm not entirely sure. But I have a feeling that focusing on the people rather than the information will get you out of thinking mode."
"Adding to this, people talk more when they can talk about themselves. Ask about their family, careers, vacations, etc. Makes you sound engaged and they talk more. You don't have to say nearly as much, they do the work. Add in a few comments here and there for momentum."

Awesome material. Thank you!
"I highly highly suggest [partaking in this test](https://www.understandmyself.com) . Let me know if you have any questions, but it will help you have a deeper understanding of yourself and how your personality is built. There is an info page where it explains in detail :)"
The YouTube channel: Charisma on Command.
"I used to struggle with this a lot when I was younger. In conversations, I was always in my own head. I focused on my own thoughts and impressions more than anything else. That approach is great for a lecture but terrible for a conversation. Think about someone youve met who you really enjoy interacting with, who makes you feel good. Im not talking about someone who provides good mental stimulation or debates with you. I specifically want you to think about someone who makes you feel comfortable opening up and discussing anything. That is a good conversationalist. That is the goal when socializing. Its not to be interesting or funny or the center of attention. Its to make whoever you are speaking to feel comfortable and special. To be a great conversationalist, you have to shift your focus from your inner thoughts to others outward feelings. Doing so isnt easy and takes some practice, but its absolutely a skill you can develop. As another person suggested, the YouTube channel Charisma on Command is EXCELLENT. It helped me hone a lot of the little skills that add up to being a better conversationalist. I would specifically recommend the video on Dwayne Johnson. It looks at how withdrawn he used to be and how it made him uninteresting and unappealing to speak with and how he turned it around and became more outgoing and engaging. For me, that video really made me realize how boring I must appear to other people since I was so deep in my head I was rarely even saying enough to keep the conversation going. And for the record, the channel has many feminine examples of women as well."
"How To Talk To Anyone by Leil Lowndes. This book doesn't have vague advice like ""be inquisitive and ask questions"", it gives you specific ways to answer and ask questions that will help you create easy flow in conversations. I LOVE this book! I borrowed the ebook for it via my local library card and the Libby app. For example, one piece of her advice is to never give a ""naked"" answer to a question. If you're asked where you are from, instead of saying, ""I am from Aspen, Colorado"", you clothe the answer with a relevant comment-- you might say, ""I am from Aspen, Colorado, but I can't ski for my life"". That let's the other person segue to skiing, something about Colorado, or something their hometown is famous for that they suck at too."
"I played the game, and I lost it. Need advice.Hello everyone! I have been around this red pill topic for a while now, I read the book ""Rational Male"" as many of you and since then, I've been looking for more info on that... I read ""The Way of Men"" too, pretty good book I'd say, not about relationship, but about menship overall, and also I am watching\\reading what people like Richard Cooper say, so I think that I am in this sphere. &#x200B; So, the reason is why I am posting here is my recent approbation of the GAME in reality, and how I lost it... Point at my fails correctly though, I am kinda interested in where I lost it. &#x200B; I have a girlfriend, we met about half a year ago, wintertime, during ice-skating, I just saw her and noticed that she is hanging out by herself, so I came and propose to glide together, after that I said that she might add my phone to her phonebook, so we can spend some time together someday, the same night she texted me. &#x200B; We were calling eachother for a while, hang out and stuff, untill we kissed and then our hanging became dating, everything was alright... &#x200B; Then after a month or so, I start trying the Rational Male arsenal on her, and then... everything went wrong. No connection, no laughing, no easy conversation and stuff, at some point she said that I changed, that something is wrong with me, that self-isolation shit killed our spark completely(we didn't meet in person for two weeks or so and the worst part is that I am not really want to see her at the time), meaning that we can't just have an easy smooth phone conversation(I hate talking over the phone btw) it ends up by misunderstanding and her's hanging up(I have some thought that this misunderstanding maybe made up by her, so I can feel guilt for not carrying it properly), then it was kinda time when she didn't call me, and I didn't call her, like who is gonna last in this silent battle, I lost, I called her(cuz I felt like it is my fault) she didn't answer, then she eventually answer and we had a conversation where I reveal the truth, like ""Baby, I am not want to do it with you, I am just trying to follow the rules of game"" she asked me what game, then I opened completely about my behavior and stuff, now I don't know if we break up or not, probably yes(and I know about Iron Rule #7 ofc). &#x200B; I understand, it is not right, accouding to Iron Rule #1, but tell me who is fucked up in that scenario? AM I? We had a real nice time together, untill I started to play a game, or did I play it wrong? I confused. z"
"When you treat relationships and human interaction like a game, or a playbook, or a video game talk system where you just select the right dialogue options and get what you want... you're bound to fail. That way of seeing a partnership is toxic and will weird out/alienate the other person. The thing to remember is that there is no rule book, no ""right"" way to talk to someone. The whole reason the red pill ""game"" philosophy is so flawed and useless is that other people aren't vending machines where you input the right code and love falls out. Everyone is a complex, feeling person just like you - the only way to win that ""game"" is to not play"
"Well, yea, that is what I am trying to say, untill I started to follow the rules of some book, everything was more or less good... Maybe it was a bad idea and the whole concept is to misguide men? I don't know, I am trying to understand that. But, there is some rules our society following and those rules apply both for macro and micro trends\behaviours, that is jsut a scientific fact"
"I think the thinking behind the book is ""this strategy worked on a couple women, now let's try it on the whole population"" or just cashing in on men who want help improving their confidence talking to women by offering it like a miracle cure. Either way, I think the best thing for you to do is to put away the books and talk to her like you used to. Remember the guy she wanted to text was the real you, without all those rules you started to follow. Good luck!"
Read - girl friend.. a friend thats a woman. A friend. Do you game your friends ? Do you try your Arsenal on them ?? Dont think so. You are your natural fun self and reach out when you feel like it. Think a little . This is idiotic.
"The concept is to create an illusion of control based on underhanded and hurtful tactics to reinforce systemic privilege. Misguided men are drawn to that sort of thing because they're self-centered and are more than willing to rationalize their own bad behavior to get what they want. Don't lean on ""Scientific Fact"" as an Appeal to Authority Fallacy, because it's very, very clear that you not only don't understand how science works, let alone people, you're taking a lot of bullshit on faith and rationalizing your beliefs in an attempt to *feel* right. Don't do that. I shouldn't have to say that, but seriously, don't. You've had a small taste of the failures you'll meet while you stay in this abuse cult, and I sincerely suggest you learn from your mistakes here or you'll continue to make them. This is a prime opportunity to cultivate empathy and personal growth. If you don't understand the terms I've used here, it would behoove you to look them up. Start with wikipedia and go from there. You must become comfortable doing your own research, be able to do some basic self-reflection, and recognize *why* certain belief systems (like TRP) are not only wrong, but actively manipulative."
"You might want to explain the Iron Rule lingo if you try posting for advice next time. Not everyone is intimately familiar with this gamey crap, I had to google it to make sense of your post. Also, your post is odd. You paint a pretty accurate picture of what happened. You randomly met a woman you liked, decided to strike up a conversation, it turns out you both liked each other, and then... > Then after a month or so, I start trying the Rational Male arsenal on her, and then... everything went wrong. Well... yes. Things tend to go wrong if you treat a woman who has any semblance of self-respect based on redpill rules. Redpill is emotionally abusive and mostly succeeds with vulnerable people, if you try it with someone who has self-esteem, it's not gonna end very well for you. Whatever you were doing until that point was clearly working, why on Earth did you try to ""start trying your arsenal on her""? A relationship is not a war. If it is, you should break up. > then it was kinda time when she didn't call me, and I didn't call her, like who is gonna last in this silent battle, I lost, I called her Don't have ""silent battles"" with people you love. It doesn't end well. Again, if you tried to force the redpill crap on her, she probably had a good reason to be frustrated with you. > I understand, it is not right, accouding to Iron Rule #1 Stop caring about what the ""Iron Rules"" say and start thinking for yourself. You two had something good, then you started playing games with her, which she didn't appreciate. Do not rely on dogma. Also, do you actually believe Rule 6? I obviously can't tell if you've ruined everything already, but if you're willing to admit that you were wrong to play games, you still might have a chance. Apologise and go back to when you two first started. If she ends it over this, you learned a valuable lesson - treat women like the people they are and don't play mind games with them based on arbitrary rules some random dude made up. Good luck."

"This isn't Windows, yo"
"What you tried were abuse and manipulation tactics whose foundation is hurting others and disrespect as a means of establishing control. *Of course* it fucking went wrong. The game is bullshit and you got what you deserved. Do not play childish, foolish games with people. If you respect her and want to keep her around, you need to take responsibility, apologize, and change your behavior, but know full well that even this isn't a guarantee. She's her own person with her own agency, and if you cannot respect that, she's gonna bounce."
"Falsifying Patriarchy.I've seen some discussion on this lately, and not been able to come up with any examples of it happening. So I'm thinking I'll open the challenge: Does anyone have examples where patriarchy has been proposed in such a way that it is falsifiable, and subsequently had one or more of its qualities tested for? As I see it, this would require: A published scientific paper, utilizing statistical tests."
Im not sure if Im looking at this too simplistically but its often touted that the legal system and laws are part of the patriarchy. Ive heard several times before that these laws are written and often enforced by men for their benefit. In spite of this there is disparity between the sentencing of men and women in federal causes. [Source](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002)
"I think you need to be more specific. All human societies which have left any enduring record have been patriarchies in the anthropological sense (with a handful of marginal cases that are more egalitarian but not clearly non-patriarchal). That is, in all human societies men have disproportional decision power. This is not controversial. The question is does this represent systematic oppression of women by men or is there some other reason why this is so."
"I'm leaving it up to the paper in question to define the structure. If it wants to go with patrilineal heritage of wealth and status, that's fine. If it wants to go with a simple majority representation in political offices, that's fine too. The more restrictive the definition, the more restricted the conclusions that naturally follow from the evidence in favor of it."
[deleted]
"> That is, in all human societies men have disproportional decision power. Wouldn't it make more sense to define that line according to wealth and not gender/sex? The vast majority of men in every society is basically powerless, while there are very few (if any) powerless wealthy people."
"The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me. Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment. You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world. There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues. The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second. The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions. I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy."

Have you ever actually listened to a feminist? No offense, but this reads like your only interactions with feminists come from Ben Shapiro reks feminists!!! or twitter screenshots of crazy people. Most feminists are rational people so if someone shows you a feminist argument that makes no sense on its face then you should be skeptical that theyre not making a straw man. For starters, knowledge isnt oppressive, that obviously makes no sense. Second, feminists dont actually believe in a male Illuminati, patriarchy is more of a social order, which leads into the next point, its not designed to be unfalsifiable its just nebulous. Similarly, socialism is where the workers own the means of production right? What percent of corporations would have to become co-ops before were not capitalist anymore? That doesnt mean capitalism and socialism are unfalsifiable, the line is just blurry. For patriarchy, theres not a hard line for what is and isnt, its more of the sum of social interactions that trend a certain way, like women being pressured to start a family instead of focusing on their career. > There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it.

Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions. This is a strange point because you can apply this logic to basically anything. Is religion not a belief system because you can make a career out of theology? If you work at a nonprofit because you believe in their mission does that make it not a belief of yours? Nowadays both left wing and right wing people can make a career out of arguing their political beliefs on YouTube, does that make it not a belief anymore? Also, can you honestly say women arent pressured into homemaking anymore? Thats the original reason behind the movements in the 60s and 70s so while progress has definitely been made, why do you think there isnt oppression anymore? >I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis.

Where's the falsifiability of the male disposability hypothesis?
Sex workers say the online market is saturated with performers and fans are canceling subscriptions during coronavirus pandemic
This makes sense. Its not any different than streaming....more people streaming but less advertisers are wanting to advertise. Advertising is very cheap right now and I would imagine cam sites would be too if the price was elastic at all. I know there was a huge uptick in onlyfans and other cam sites. Its supply and demand. What did you want to discuss?
"Most service industries have completely collapsed. Sex work is a sort of service industry. Though as you said, it's one of those that relies a lot on advertising and advertising is mostly dependent on service industries. Some things like video games and streaming services are seeing initial upticks in interest, but that's going to fall off over time due to knock on effects from the rest of the industry."
"Well, economy collapsed and so did discretionary spending especially for lower middle class and below."
well the economy collapsing affects women more than men cause men were no longer able to have jobs cause the government mandate it
"I hate porn, is mostly anti-male hetero trash promoting the gyno gaze"
"Most of the time when we discuss gender stuff and porn, the arguments boil down to, ""What I like is good and what I dislike is bad."" Human sexualities are stupid complicated and essentially everyone has their own unique set of preferences for body types and personality, kinks, and turn offs. It's not really a place where there's much to debate about specifics. There's only a few generalizations that can really be made, like pedophile porn being clearly bad since it actually hurts the children involved."
"No, porn is homophobic, gynocentric and anti male"
Can you explain why you believe this?
Cause it focuses on the sexual desires of hetero males and lesbians This is the rare case of gynocentrism disadvantaging women
"Girlfriends shyness and weak eye contact pushes me out of my zoneSo I've been with this girl for 2 months now and she has this weird behavior when we are together, lets say sitting on a park bench where she talks a lot and we get along great, but she sits with her legs crossed, barely looks me in the eyes and generally has a closed body language. This makes me kinda out of my zone if you get me, I know it's as simple as ""let me kiss you"" (i tried and it works) but her ""coldness"" just sort of pushes me away and I end up sitting next to her wishing I was instead with a friend smoking a joint. Any tips on how to stay in my zone with a shy/physically closed girl?"
How does she act when you two are not in a public setting?
that has not occurred yet... she didn't call me over yet because i assume she doesn't ever have the house to herself ... same situation as my own
What about when you guys are in the car? Perhaps take a hike or long walk where there are less people so you can see if she opens up more
Is she even your girlfriend at that point?
Presumably OP is very young and when you are that young you can go from first date to gf real quick haha
"eh, to be honest it sounds like a regular relationship in my culture & age if girls want a serious relationship they won't be having sex with you 3 dates in"
"Calibrate. Is she actually closed off, or is that just how her body talks? Have you ever seen the eye chart of eye accessing cues? The good ones tell you that it's just a generalization, and you have to calibrate them."
I feel you brotha
"Hang on. I am surprised no one has brought up the obvious thing to do here. She is your girlfriend for fuck's sake. The very simple, least investment thing to do here is to ask her how she feels when you do XYZ thing. Candor is always appreciated in most scenarios. How old are you out of curiosity?"
"I think men and women are far more similar than both MRAs and Feminists portrayI see a lot of posts explaining how men and women are so different and so thats why its so difficult for them to understand each other. I think men and women have very few fundamental differences. Yes, physically they have differences, like men tend to be taller and larger etc. But psychologically (Im not an expert so I could be wrong) there dont seem to be a huge amount of big differences. The idea that men are more logical and less emotional is lost on me, because I am a very emotional person, and so is my father. My mother on the other hand is logical and very unemotional. I know this is anecdotal, but I dont think it is uncommon."
"Greater variability as an evolutionary trait is a huge one. Basically for a number of stats, men are more varied then women. This shows up often in very high achieving careers as more men will have those traits due to the distribution. In terms of overal performance it means men will make up a greater proportion of the top and bottom of most brackets. More CEOs and more homeless in practical terms. Also there are psychological differences that derive from biology. A man who is tall and strong might walk through that dark construction site home at night without fear and a woman might not. The risk taking and the feeling of fear these feel and experience might be the result of biology even if exposed to a similar or the same environment. Its not so easy to say that there are just physical differences when those physical differences amplify in part our behavior. Etc."
"True, I hadnt thought about how much the physical aspect impacts the psychological differences. Thats interesting. Thanks for the input. I think mostly what Ive had a bit of an issue with is that a lot of MRAs and Feminists talk about the poner gender as if they are the other and almost the enemy. They almost group all men or all women together as if they all have the same thoughts and traits."
The problem is that we also influence each other. How would women be different if women stayed the same but the paired sex was smaller and weaker. Suddenly that smaller and weaker sex might value completely different traits and women might develop differently. Lots of our understanding of sex differences has to do with comparison to the other. You cant just remove it and consider one sex in a vaccuum because that is not how a dimorphic species like humanity develops. Men and women have different thoughts and traits purely by coexisting with the other.
"It's trends in behaviour. You're right that the similarities far outweigh the differences but the differences can have an impact in aggregate. It's not a one size fits all but they do have an impact. At least, this is my understanding. The major differences come into play at the extremes of the deviation with some being more prominent than others. For example, interest in things vs people. I'd agree that the perception of difference is greater than the differences themselves but your main argument is a bit of a Strawman against Feminists and MRAs to be honest. Feminism thinks the differences are small but socialisation makes men more violent on average (to use an example) and MRAs think socialisation and biology have an impact on behaviours but also that the negative traits of men are over reported and negative traits in women are under reported (and vice versa with positive traits). Your argument doesn't really tackle either of these."
"I guess so, I have created a judgment of what I think a lot of MRAs and Feminists think based on listening to a few which is probably quite unfair (ironic since thats what Ive accused them of doing haha)."
"I generally agree but there is evidence for fairly large personality differences between men and women: *""The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality""*. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029265 In particular, women are far more sensitive and ""easily offended"" than men are, which probably goes a long way towards explaining the stereotype about women being more emotional than men. It's hard to tell if this is biological or social but in the real world these differences are pretty pronounced."
"I would say that claiming men and women are the same/very similar is a very feminist view. Feminists have been arguing for the last century against neurosexism, which is the view that there are distinct differences between the male and female brain- see Cordelia Fine Delusions of Gender and the book Im currently reading by Gina Rippon, called The Gendered Brain. She systematically identifies and disproves myths such as the greater male variability hypothesis and the idea that women and men are psychologically different. It just seems to me like the whole history of the feminist movement is made up of feminists saying were just like men, we can do ___ just as well and for __ insert things like being a leader, being educated. Feminists have been trying to prove that men and women are equal for decades."
"There is a double standard here though. I've been arguing for a while that if men and women really are more similar than different, that women are just as capable of violence and abusive behaviors as men, including rape. I use this rhetoric a lot when talking to feminists specifically. *""Why is this the only issue where you think men are different?""* The problem ultimately comes down to them only ever caring about gender stereotypes when they negatively effect women, while at the same time amplifying negative stereotypes about men (I guess to make women look better?). The result is that they end up perpetuating the same antiquated, Victorian style gender norms that they claim to be against."
"There are barely any differences at all in the brain but most males dont accept because ""muh physical strength/muh bible"" or they bitch about ""whamen emotional"" and more feminists dont care because of fbi statistics and the double standards that exist that were put in place by males."
"Falsifying hypergamyAnother day, another concept to look at critically. I figure I'll keep swinging the pendulum, and I'll eagerly accept any suggestions for future concepts. Does anyone have examples where hypergamy has been proposed in such a way that it is falsifiable, and subsequently had one or more of its qualities tested for? As I see it, this would require: A published scientific paper, utilizing statistical tests. Though I'm more than happy to see personal definitions and suggestions for how they could be falsified. (I find complaints about the subject/request without actual contribution equally endearing, but won't promise to take it seriously.)"
"I genuinely don't understand hypergamy as a negative construct. I have never met a person who said that when looking for a partner, they didn't want the best one they could get. Isn't that just human nature?"
"Is earning a good measure of ""best one they could get"" though?"
Maybe? If someone grew up in poverty is seems like a natural instinct to want to try and get out of it.
"I believe it depends on the construct. If the definition is: Women want to settle down with the best man they can, I believe it's quite reasonable."
"I actually don't fault women for doing this. I do think it has several negative effects in society (life expectancy, quality of life, wage gap, child care gap, etc), and is not ideal from an equality standpoint. And on the topic of feminism I think it counters the idea that men have more power and privilege in society than women. And there might be angles in evopsych and sociology that are ""interesting"", just from the standpoint of knowledge being interesting. But like I said I don't fault women for it and I don't think many MRAs do either. Some men may be bitter after being taken to the wringers in divorce court. So it's not like there aren't issues in society that need addressed because of it. But I don't think any man if put in the same position would do anything different than what most women do."
"So, just like rape culture, and the other things in this series, I'm going to make the same complaint. I think it's impossible to ""falsify"" hypergamy. I don't think it's something that exists universally in our world. I think there are clusters that have factors and pressures that make it worse than in other places (and vice versa, really) Certainly, I don't think every woman follows that sort of hypergamy path. Maybe most don't. I don't know. But I wouldn't say it's NEVER the case. Because that's obviously not true. And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal. Again, the best we can do is look at local factors. That's probably the best information we can use on these topics."
"Is it hypocritical that I hate the porn industry but regularly engage in BDSM?So, for context, I'm a lesbian woman. I generally consider myself a sex-positive feminist, although I'm extremely critical of pornography because I think that, while it's theoretically okay in a vacuum, it really perpetuates super harmful ideas in practice. And the porn industry itself is fucking disgusting. On the other hand, my girlfriend and I get pretty experimental in the bedroom. She's into some pretty intense degradation type stuff, and kind of introduced me into being more dominant, and ai enjoy it. Sometimes I feel like engaging in this makes me a bit hypocritical. I was wondering, what are other feminists' opinions on this sort of thing?"
"I don't think that ""disliking the porn industry"" and ""engaging in consensual power exchanges in the bedroom"" are at all at odds with each other. I don't think they're even in the same neighborhood."
I'd agree with these comments. I don't think they're even comparable to be hypocritical because they're completely different things
Yup!

"Some of the top viewed stuff on pornhub at one time was supposedly a step brother boning his sleeping stepsister. Thats, rape, incest, and a whoke bunch of wrong all in one. Personally I get indulging a kink but this on top of a lot of the sexist practices of the industry... I can totally understand the view that its very problematic. Not everyone sees the difference between porn and reality. On top of that... this is speculative really, but you know how in movies you get a bunch of disclaimers at the end? Nobody was harmed. This was a work of fiction. Nothing was harmed during the making of this etc etc. we dont get as many of those garuntees of safety, respect, and (for lack of a better word) wholesomeness in porn. Especially on tube sites where most of that is cut out anyway. For all we know what were watching is a sex slave and their abuser. Thats just my personal take on it mind you. Porn and smut is a grey area. But I agree with others on OP. Engaging in safe consensual activity is very different from supporting questionable things the porn industry may do."

Painal is a type of porn content. Why explore anal sex together and create mutual pleasure when you can get yourself off while inflicting damaging pain on your partners organs?? Thats the kind of super harmful idea thats out there.
"What you do in the bedroom is your business and only YOUR business, as long as you consent to it"
Unless your kink is exploiting your partner on a webcam and shes less than enthusiastic about it.... you would not be a hypocrite.
"Is there a sub like LivelikeKings, but for women?I would love to join a subreddit for true female empowerment. I would appreciate learning more about appreciating my femininity in alignment with God, philosophy, and active approaches to become better. In that male sub, I see that the men there have truly pinpointed the problems that our currently plaguing men (consumerism, porn, lack of responsibility), and I think women have a lot too in our current soicety. What do you guys think?"

Here is a newborn subreddit made to fulfil your needs. *https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMistressDen?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share*
"I am so thankful you have created a sub! I dont adore the name however. I feel like mistress is something that is inherently connected to a man, and not in a positive way? I want the sub to be geared toward encouraging women to step away from degeneracy and work toward their personal growth goals. One problem I think women struggle with is seeking validation from others on social media, how we can aim to feel content and fufilled without external sources. And discussing problems like that and how to solve it. What do you think?"
"I took the name after this definition: **mistress** */mstrs/* noun 1. a woman in a position of authority or control. *""she is alwaysmistress ofthe situation, coolly self-possessed""* And I think, since it was your idea, you should be a mod to this sub. I will follow you on Reddit then send you an invite."
"I disagree that mistress is only used in connection to a man. It's the feminine version of master. It certainly has other definitions, but it's not inherently referential to men."
"Thank you for your support.Thank you all for the lovely messages Ive gotten over the past couple days. Everything has been such a blur family and friend and people from the community who my husband and father impacted. My father trained the rabbi who gave his service. My husbands students carried his coffin. Ive gotten so many letters and phone calls just sharing what my father and husband did for the people of our community. I never realized what sort of pillars in the community they were . My father was a rabbi for 40 years so the number of weddings, funeral, bris, mitzvahs is probably uncountable. The time he spent counseling is immeasurable. Theres probably no way to measure my fathers impact. My husband ran a book store and taught at the Yeshiva and was super active in the community. My husband was always there when someone needed him and gave deeply and frequently. Thats what I want my children to know their father and grandfather as. Caring and giving people who made the world better. Im slowly getting used to a new normal without my husband. My whole routine is shifted without him. Im trying to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. Ive been trying to keep for crying in front of them. But I keep breaking down. Im not strong and this hard and terrifying and painful. I dont see another side to this."

'Can I help you with anything?' 'Yes, pour me a drink' Anything else?' 'Pour yourself a drink' 'Anything else?' 'Ya worry about yourself and if something is missing when your food is on the table then ask me about it'"" She said the following: ""Can I just say how impressed I am at your ability to kickstart conversation? I HATE texting. Haaaaate it. Yet I actually want to respond to you. Because now I want to know what you enjoy experimenting with in the kitchen"" (upside down smiley face) I love her response and how positive it is yet I've completely drawn a blank on a flirty line to say to her. Just need some flirty suggestions. I'm sure the answer is starting me in the face I but I have writers block. Could use the community's help. Thanks!"

This and keep escalating.

"I know. I AM pretty impressive. ;) What do I like experimenting with in the kitchen? You'll have to come over for dinner and find out. How's Wednesday or Friday? Be a little cocky. Her response sounds like a great opening to invite her over, so give it a shot. Lead her. Don't say ""Would you like to blah blah blah? What day is good for you?"" Say ""This is what I'm inviting you to do. These are some days I'm available to do it"" If she responds positively, tell her it's her job to bring wine. She gets to decide, but you will be judging her choice. Be playful. Or ya know, just ""be yourself"" or some other terrible un-actionable advice. Lol. Good luck, man."

"What is your opinion on John Stoltenberg's view that masculinity and femininity are artificially created concepts that should be abandoned entirely? He also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic (I'll get into the details below, he did an interview where he explains why)In case you didn't know, he describes himself as a radical feminist. He did an interview with Vice.com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic, but I think I can summarize them pretty well in this post. [Here's his full interview with Vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic&ved=2ahUKEwjbmcu_5fnoAhXDTN8KHQ12B80QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1cB20RqEciXqCreKtu6mEY&ampcf=1). I recommend reading it. Basically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have, man or woman. Men can be shy, quiet, emphatic, etc. and women can be violent, aggressive, prideful, etc. John think's it's unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other, and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine. Likewise, women can be violent too, and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine. All these traits should just be viewed as human traits. I pretty much agree with this point of view. However, he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity (as social concepts/ideas/roles) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression, while femininity does not. As such, he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic, because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn't promote. Even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women, he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity. Still, he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with. Thoughts? I recommend reading the interview with Vice."

I would disagree with you & agree with Stoltenberg. Masculinity & femininity are made up ideas intended to associate a particular style of being with a gender identity - and then used to reward or punish people for how they act. This is crap. We'd be better off without it. (And that doesn't mean abandoning gender identity).
"Please respect our top-level comment rule, which requires that all direct replies to questions posted to AskFeminists must come from feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective. Theres nothing particularly feminist in your post history, and I cant see how this is a feminist perspective. Comment removed; since you are new to the sub (as you say), you will probably want to lurk and read a bit more (which I hope that you do!)."
"Very good interview/article. This is an idea I've been discussing with others a lot lately; that of qualities being genderless. ""If someone is transitioning from male to a trans woman, it is the core self that makes the passage from one vessel to the next. Our character is divorced from our gender."" I think this sums up a lot. It's never made sense to me to designate and categorize human traits; after all, anyone can and does possess any quality, with any gender. Where does this leave masculinity and femininity? As mere concepts and ideas that have been associated with sex. Any culture can make up a set of ideas that are ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" to their particular social structure. Releasing the need to live up to social standards and ideas about gender frees one to live truer to their human self, their most moral ideal. Edit: r/menslib often discusses this very topic with much intelligence. If you don't follow them, do!"
I think masculinity and femininity are fine as long as it is recognized that people of all sexes have both inside them.
"The only problem I have with that is, what are those concepts? And if they can't be readily defined across cultures then what is the point of making the designation when there's no meaning? Seems a slippery slope."
"Gender identity ast it's core is no different to any other identity. It's a set of characteristics that are chosen to express oneself. Of course there is a lot of social conditioning invloved so one can argue if it is a conscious choice but no one is born masculine or feminine in the same way no one is born a punk or a lover of musicals. Gender identity can be problematic for two reasons. One, due to the huge discrimination people face for what is or isn't hanging between their legs, and the fact that gender identity is often tied up with that, means it's not as trivial as identifying a punk for example. Two because of the aforementioned discrimination gender identity can often be empowering. So while I disagree with gender entirely and think it's complete bullshit. I won't ever call someone out for having one. I'm saying this as a white hetronormative cis gendered male. So I can't ever really know the empowerment a gender identity might bring. My identity has never been under attack. My point is the above commentor is saying there is nothing wrong with saying bodybuilding is masculine or knitting is feminine as long as recognise a man or woman can do either and don't pigeonhole people. But of course they are free to correct me if I got the wrong end of the stick."
"I like Stoltenberg's ideas a lot. (And in his favor, he's trans-inclusive, which is somewhat rare for a radical feminist.) From what I understand, he's sort of saying that, like whiteness, maleness is inherently defined in opposition to an oppressed other. He's not saying that every trait seen as masculine is toxic, but rather that the need to feel secure in a constructed male identity leads to devaluation of women, and that traits should be evaluated by the standard of what makes a good person rather than what makes a good man or woman. Edit: I do describe myself as a masculine person, but that has nothing to do with seeing myself as male (I'm a cis woman). It's more a description of how people perceive me based on my appearance and mannerisms. I don't think it's contradictory to want to do away with assigning different traits to different genders while also acknowledging that in our current society, people still perceive those traits as gendered."
"I think it might take centuries to do away with the idea of gender altogether. For now, it seems the best route is to envision a different type of masculinity."

"Boyfriend [30M] is accusing me [29F] of riding the cock carouselThis is a throwaway account since my boyfriend knows my main Reddit account and I dont want him stumbling upon this post To give some info, I [29F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] in the relationship phase for around 5 months now. We were in the dating phase for around 3 months before he asked me if I was interested in becoming a couple (relationship). I was initially surprised since I felt it was a bit soon for me, but I did (do) like him a lot and thought why not give it a shot and see what happens. I feel that our chemistry has been very similar to the dating phase to the relationship phase, other than the fact we are dealing with lockdowns right now (like most people around the world). I like him a lot! I really do. But, I have noticed over the last month or so of talking with me, he brings up a lot of interesting topics around me. Last weekend when we were together, we ended up having this conversation where he was saying; *You were riding the cock carousel before you met me.* - things like that. I did figure out in the dating phase that he liked the YouTuber, Entrepreneurs in Cars, since we talked about a couple of videos that Rich Cooper posted (he likes him). One of the reasons I like my boyfriend a lot is because I feel we can talk about pretty much anything and have good discussions. Im always trying to be the feminine addition to his life and compliment him on his journey. However, I dont like him accusing me of things like riding the cock carousel, or even when he mentioned me possibly monkey branching on him for another guy. The last few times these comments have come up, it has bothered me quite a bit because I like him a ton. I dont like him accusing me of things that are not true (i.e. I havent rode the CC). Im looking for advice on how to approach this topic if/when it comes up again. For some reason, I feel like it will come up again at a later date and I would like to shut it down completely. Any thoughts or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

"I feel like the number is irrelevant--she may have only been with 3 partners previously and to him, this is too much. The number is highly subjective to anyone. Bringing up a specific number probably won't do much for this issue."
[deleted]
I just threw out a number for the example This proves my point though: the number is controversial in itself. He may consider 10 to be the CC or 30 or even more... there's no telling
"It's kind of a dick move on his part. His attitude is really disrespectful. If I were you, I'd tell him that he had better start treating you better or you are going to walk. You cannot change your past (not implying that you did ride the CC). Your past is part of what makes you who you are and it is part of your complete package. He doesn't have the right to criticize it. If he doesn't like it he should walk away."

"***Remind him that he chose you*** He needs to pick a street; whether its accept or reject you, rather than bully you with regurgitated red pill terms that are meant for the women that he is supposed to avoid, not the one he brings in close to himself.

Remember, We train the people in our lives how to treat us."
Thank you for your comment and perspective
"I am a man. I thought i would provide you with a different perspective. Your BF seems to be red-pill aware a little bit. If he was smart enough, he would not even mention to you that he is aware of any red pill theory. Instead, he would just lead. Regarding whether you rode the CC or not, the mens subreddit advises not to ask women about N-count. Does the number matter? 100%. However, he chose you, so he has to deal with any baggage that you carry. If it bothered him so much, then he shouldnt have become exclusive with you. From what I can tell, hes watched a few of Richs videos, and got a little excited."

I think it's just the political landscape that we are in right now to be honest
"You can. A couple of shit articles, editorials, and interviews don't make your mouth incapable of talking if you wanna say fat chicks are gross."
"You can say whatever you like, but other people have the same opportunity."
Who cares what some dumb hole blathering gibberish for clicks for their corporate masters says you can talk about women's bodies all you want see I just did it dumb holes I'll do it again lizzo only thinks you shouldn't be able to talk about women's bodies because lizzo is in possession of lizzo's body Ain't no laws against it
Well... it's just the ay it is. A woman asking for a man's hight is ok. A woman dismissing (ghosting) a man because he's not tall enough? That's ok too. A man probing whether a woman is fit or fat? Unacceptable!
I mean you CAN. Its just not a good idea to criticize the bodies of the women youre tryna fuck lol. Thats the thing ; when theyre ragging on you its usually Bc youre there trying to fuck them. You standing there trashing her body and then asking to fuck it is a bad look.
"Just women's BS double standards. All identity groups are hypocritical. It's only a problem when the identity hypocrisy crap is weaponized and reified as a Politics instead of a sociological phenomenon. This is the whole problem with all forms of IP. They all politicize and weaponize the irrational BS of the identity group and create politics, rules, and even laws based on the egotistical lies of the ethnic group. IP is politics based on pure lies. This is why it is bad in all forms. The female hypocritical BS noted by OP is just women's politics or feminism and shows why feminism along with all other IP's is so toxic, dishonest, and dangerous. People can never be honest about themselves due to the ego roadblock. The exact same problem exists in all IPs, which are nothing more than conglomerations of the collective egos of groups that share an idhentity. These groups are susceptible to all the irrationalities of individual egotism. IP is simply egotism writ large."

"How is non-neediness different from arrogance or disinterest?For a long time, I have had to problem to understand what neediness is to begin with. But now to some extent I think I get it. However, most times my non-neediness comes across as disinterest or arrogance. For ex: A girl expects me to be in touch with her constantly. We can't be meeting all the time. She expects that we are in touch with each other constantly either through call or text. So, I'd say I'm busy or I'd say normally I don't text so much but rather I'd like to meet in person instead. Somehow, she ignores this and keeps texting me. Now if I do respond to her everytime she texts me, I'd be texting all day long and eventually I'll come across as low value. On the other hand if I don't reply or take a long time to reply, it'll come across as disinterest or arrogance and she may auto-reject or go find someone who can cater to her needs. If I like the girl, I'll be losing her either way. How do I balance this? P.S: Above example can show up in different forms and at different stages. This question may have been asked already but I couldn't get an answer that I'm specifically looking for in this context. So had to re-ask"
"If you get a good answer, remind me to comeback here"
It's not arrogance to worry about yourself. It's arrogance to think you're above everyone else. The disinterest comes as a natural effect because you're working on you. Which happens to be attractive.
"It mostly has to do with your ability to communicate and frame expectations. Saying youre not a texter is good, but you might also respond to say youre not available until x amount of time, then deliver on that promise and reach out in your preferred way to be considerate. If she doesnt answer or respond just leave a message to say you were thinking of her and would have liked to connect. And youll be available until x or available again at z. What Im saying is you cant be considered as arrogant if you are considerate. You cant be considered disinterested if you are delivering on your stated intentions."
"Being disinterested means ""I don't want you"". Being non-needy means ""I don't need you, but I want you"". If you want an overarching idea to follow, I'd recommend that As for your specific example - if a girl uses text messaging differently from you, then just be straight with her on how you use it. If you don't often text because you have other things on your plate, then simply tell her this but remind her that you're still interested and want to see her If you lose the girl because she liked texting more than you then (1) you dodged a bullet because she might have been using you for attention, or (2) you both dodged a bullet because you two expect to be using texting in a different way in a relationship As a general rule, don't change your behaviour in an unsustainable way for anybody - it'll lead to both of you being dissatisfied at the end"
I didn't read your entire post. But non neediness means you have better things in life than girls. You don't need to rely on a girl to make you happy. It takes the pressure of her and also shows that you are successful in life.
I don't think the auto reject is something you should worry about. If she's down to text you all day and you're not in the friendzone you're chilling. Way to go to not come off as low value
"This relates to a concept that's mentioned in No More Mr Nice Guy. Men who are extremely needy assume that, to be not needy, you should be the polar opposite - completely disinterested. In truth, it's about striking a balance by having clear boundaries you don't cross. Highly recommend you read the book if you struggle with needy behavior. To apply this to your example. The girl who wants you to be in touch constantly is playing on your neediness. You obey her because you desperately want your needs met, but it's actually hurting you. You appear low value because you're too available. Nothing else more important is taking up your time? No job? No gym? No hobby? No friends? That subcommunicates that she's more important than anything else going on in your life. Not what she's looking for. A boundary you can set is that you won't placate women who demand your attention. She can learn to deal with you being unavailable or she can find someone else to annoy. You'll find that actually this boundary might upset her initially. But, if she's a good person, she'll respect you for having the self-respect and self-confidence and self-assurance to set and enforce a personal boundary. Men who capitulate demonstrate a weak character."
"There is a difference between need and want. Youre allowed to act like you want someone lol idk where this societal belief of the idgaf attitude came about, having wants is okaaaay lol. Now acting like you need the girl is different"
"If she ignores what you say and keeps on with what she wants to say it's because you let her do so. If you're losing her because she asks you more than you can give is it really a big loss? If yes, then you're needy. Put your boundaries, don't let her take control of the frame and if she cannot take it and goes away, great, because you shouldn't have her stay in a situation that doesn't make her happy anyways."
Serious question for debate - please comment. How is Jake not given the consideration of being a rape victim?
"I'm pretty sure this has been called out as fake most of the previous times I've seen it posted. &#x200B; But yeah, it does sound like something the people in university title ix offices would probably be in favor of making real."
"In recent years, the acceptability of what counts as rape has increased massively and the definition widened. A traditional view is simply women cannot be raped (and even in many developed countries e.g UK, legally a woman can't rape anyone even a child) This will definitely lead to more cases now where men will have been raped by women... when a woman decides to carry on for 1 minute after the man hasn't consented? Was that finger consensual? What if the man was drunk? Sleepy? Title IX standards of evidence should make them easy to prove. I wonder if believe men will pick up as a hashtag as these cases come to light. Oh and we already have the story here, see thread about the woman who raped a boy by stating she would falsely accuse him of rape if he didn't,"
"The poster has in fact been confirmed as having been produced by 'Coastal Carolina University', more specifically published in 2008 by the 'Campus Assault Resource Education Support Coalition' They don't seem to stand by it today, fortunately."
Let's discuss a poster that has been disavowed for the last 12 years.
These are not fake I saw them on the train as an ad when I was 15 in Canada
"wow, I feel like saying sorry you had to see such sexist bullshit. Damn that's bad if it was that big a campaign. You remembered it as well so would have stuck out"
"Yup I remember seeing these on the train when I was 15 back in 2010, back then as a 15 yo boy I thought these ads were sexist, full grown adults created these and paid to have them everywhere; sexism is very prevalent against men"
This poster is a good expose at how feminist view rape. Yes they no longer stand by it. But it's like the remarkably racist comment someone makes in a discord channel. Even after they delete the comment you still know they are racist.
"Turns out boys and teenage boys are 36.4% more likely to be victims of domestic violence by an intimate partner than girls. Look like a pattern than with the pic above you got babies, now with this data you got boys. I wonder if gender biased feminist campaigns about DV have had an affect as this is younger people? [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50390689?intlink\_from\_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c008ql15dvgt/domestic-abuse&link\_location=live-reporting-story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50390689?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c008ql15dvgt/domestic-abuse&link_location=live-reporting-story) Note that above article despite boys being 36.4% more likely to be victims, pictured girls only. Until someone campaigned and got the picture changed."
"Looking for help for a friendNot sure this is the right place to post this, but a friend of mine has a son. Hes 17 or 18. And hes spouting off a lot of red pill type sexism. Is there anything she can do to help him get out of this before he becomes even more extreme?"
"Honestly, it's got to be up to the person themself to break out of it, in my opinion. When I was super into it I didn't listen to anyone telling me anti-redpill stuff. It was only after seeing the consequences of my actions that I decided I needed to stop."
I was afraid of that.
"Strong female role models, seeing that there good women out there who dont like or fall for red pill stuff."
Thank you.
"More like positive female role model, the redpillers tend to use the strong I dont need no man type of archetype as their boogie man that may reinforce the ideation . Try to show him that there are amazing good women out there, men tend to care more about things then people so use women in scientific and technical fields that improve humanity as examples."
"His mother is a widowed nurse. And he seems to have major issues with her being a woman and not being a conservative, as well as major issues with his older sister."
I'd try the good old Socratic method. TRP theory is so flimsy I can bet it won't withstand an honest half-an-hour conversation. You just need to question all his assumptions.
"TRP collapses under the weight of its internal contradictions and biological essentialism. For instance, men getting into relationships for their ability to provide, rather than any genuine attraction---""beta bucks"" as TRP would have it---is a feature of patriarchal setups where women were unable to support themselves (or indeed exercise any real choice in choosing a partner or a life). The solution to this problem is allowing women education, careers, and agency, but TRPers seem to vehemently oppose and resent this---just one of the many ways in which they're full of shit."
"In my experience, he has to have cognitive dissonance. A comment in this thread gave the idea of a strong female model, in order to make him challenge his beliefs, I think thats a great idea."
"What can I do to increase my exposure to women?Ill probably get downvoted and shit on for this post, but here it goes. Ive read all the recommended books here. Ive studied seduction and attraction for years. Ive read the sidebar. At this point I feel that Ive got an information overload and that it has fucked my brain up, honestly. I am 24 and have had sex with 13 girls. Im currently on a 2 year dry spell. Heres a breakdown of where I met the women Ive fucked: **School**: 3 **Tinder**: 6 **Work**: 4 I am not in school now. Tinder doesnt work for me anymore. My current job has no attractive females. I am a decent looking dude and understand the many concepts of seduction and attraction. However, with the only three areas that Ive had success with women out of the picture, Ive got no clue where to meet women to end this dry spell. Im not depressed about it or anything, I actually really value my time alone. I just think its time to smash some walls or maybe put myself into a position to have a selection of girls that I can choose from to have a intimate relationship with. What are your recommendations to maximize my exposure, and what could I be doing wrong?"
1. Salsa lessons. 2. Yoga 3. Crossfit 4. Conferences related to your job.
lol these are lame
Not always the best LTRs... but have you not tried pubs and clubs?
"Women do not go to bars, pubs and clubs alone. They go with other girls to look for hot guys, not to be approached by average guys, OP is likely not above average otherwise would not be here."
Grow balls and approach women whereever you see them
"I agree. Sometimes girls just hit you up and make it really easy for you to do the rest. Makes me laugh when people talk about how ""pErSonaLitY"" is the most important thing when they look for sexual partners. OP listen to this guy"
"OP, do not listen to this. This guy is taking his experience and assuming its the norm. Its not."

How to not overlook good guys?I was alpha widowed (for lack of better wording but essentially I mean hung up on an ex) in my early twenties so much that I overlooked a guy that was even better for me/ a much better catch. This guy chased me for a year and I pushed him away. two years later we had another shot and now Im the one heartbroken over him (he attended graduate school and now has more ladies throwing themselves at him). He was a great amazing guy from the beginning but I overlooked him because I was in so much pain over an ex. Now that Im heartbroken again I dont want to repeat the cycle. Any tips on how I can make sure I dont repeat history/ keep overlooking great guys because Im hung up on an ex?
"Therapy, journalling, self-work to work out what you want in a man."
"Seeing the potential in people is an important skill. Everyone has some problem. Don't wait for the perfect person. And never be in so much pain over an ex... women have a biological advantage in this regard because of the shifted scale in attraction as the ""selectors"" of the human race. Your ""selector"" role is also why you happen to have this problem of not knowing who is ""good enough"" because selectors in any species tend to make picky choices (which is usually a good thing ""high standards"" leads to be a better species evolution---if that is your conscious goal... or... is it your subconscious goal?). In other words, you ask yourself what do you want for yourself?"

"A marriage to a good man won't work if you aren't attracted to him. It won't feel good for you. If you're mentally unhealthy, good men might not always be attractive to you. I notice a lot of young women who call themselves ""alpha widowed"" tend to bring up later that they have mental health issues too. Some reasons good men might not catch your eye... -You might have ""intimacy fears"" that stop you from genuinely connecting with people in a healthy way. -You might have low self esteem issues that cause you to accept the love you think you deserve (unfulfilling) rather than the love you desire (fulfilling). -You might have an ""attachment style"" that creates bad dynamics. -You grew up in an unhealthy environment and haven't resolved issues from childhood. Often we can confuse what feels familiar with what is attractive. Until you address your issues so that your body registers that familiarity as a red flag, this can make balanced and healthy people unappetizing. If any of this sounds familiar, therapy can be a huge help. If none of this sounds relevant, perhaps your criteria are too stringent on things that don't matter and perhaps lax on ones that do. ""Marry Him"" by Lori Gotttlieb is a solid book if you're worried you're in this camp."
"""Whole Again"" by McKenzie, ""Dark Side of the Inner Child"" by Wolinsky has exercises to help you do this."
I think you need to work on yourself first. There's obviously something going on keeping you from wanting an obvious choice. Figure out what that is and work on it.
Therapy meditation and prayer
"The sexual selection mechanism, which is how you feel in terms of attraction, doesnt select for this, so you need to make conscious modern world alterations to the primal strategy of sexual selection. Youre attracted to a guy at the top of some hierarchy, or at least who presents honest signals of being there. This is why psychopaths are attractive, bad boys, the best at sport, celebrities, confident frame-controller, etc. Men do not start at the top of the dominance hierarchy, they work for it. Unlike the past, men have a good chance at getting there without being murdered or put in their place by those already at the top. Sort of more fair, where hard work is more likely to pay off at the very least. So, you dont need to aim for guys already at the top (or at the best youve ever had and expect you can get), which is some consolation. Since you can invest in a guy and he can get there after the fact. Yeah it sucks that you cant just wait at the finish line. But, you can make a difference to a mans life and allow him the frame, be feminine for him and allow him to maintain and steadily grow into a more ideal man which benefits you and him. Not manipulation, but simply being feminine brings out qualities for a man. Win-win. If he is to be this level of attractive to you, he will get the attention of other women. So youll try to get commitment and manipulate him to ensure your security and this will generate beta behaviour from him if he gives in, its called poison dripping and makes him worse so that you feel secure. And then hell be unattractive. Or he doesnt give in, but maybe he sleeps around and you dont want that either. Win-lose in short term maybe, lose-lose in long term definitely And on and on, there is no ideal for you, no perfect situation without a compromise. *Conclusion*: figure out what you want to compromise, to sacrifice, and what you value most. What is the ideal situation, what is the ideal man? Do you have the red pill knowledge to simulate the potential downfalls and to figure out if that ideal situation is realistic. Make your goal specific in that way. Figure out if it is realistic, and achievable."
"I think your real problem is living in the past. You get hung up on the one that got away. These past relationships that didnt work for whatever reason, you need to stop believing that either of them could have worked out if you had done anything differently."
"I, 25M have been a lonely, neckbeard creep all my life. I need help to break from this virginity hell!a bit of a longwinded and touchy one here folks but bear with me. So Ive gone through so many of these wanna get better phases and it pisses me off. I have all the horrible weaknesses in the world to make dating almost impossible for me. OCD, autism, social anxiety and misophonia. Ive tried PUA and dating sites to disastrous results. The former I didnt know any better about and I regret even trying it. And with this era of Coronavirus, not going outside has got me to this point. I am an autistic neckbeard creep. And I wanna stop. Here are some examples of digging myself into a hole: * I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside * Im on Disability Welfare * I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient. * Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. * I am 130kg I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood. The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic. But enough ranting, I just wonder what I can put in effort in for now while Im stuck at home. What will I be able to do to start living a non-creep life? What things can I attend, how can I get my confidence up? Im basically starting from ground zero here :/ Finally, I wonder if this is even possible? Turning 26, never got remotely in a close relationship in my entire life and being an autist I really worry to see that I can get more mature than identically a 12yo Thanks for the help :)"
"If possible get out and go on some walks, perhaps turn it into jogging. But make sure you obey social distancing. Its something you can do by yourself that can help you get out a little."
Ive done that for a week and it really helped actually. Mainly for brain training tho lol.
"Get into lifting. Strength training. Stronglifts 5x5 is a good way to start. Look into intermittent fasting. Try eating less bit by bit. Pay attention to you physical appearance (eg groom yourself, visit the barber regularly, keep it shaved down there). Why? Because in order to achieve something you have to behave like youve already achieved it. Git going son"
Yea defs Thanks for the help. Hmmm
"Get a job and get off welfare, thats step 1. Go to school and get into a decent paying career."
"Look man Im not gonna lie to you, but I never thought I was gonna lose my virginity. I lost it at 21, kind of late compare to my peers. Honestly, I was pressured by friends to lose it. However, I held my ground and just told them if I lose it Ill lose it. What Im saying is dont put losing your virginity on a pedestal, when I first had sex it was awkward asf. When I first lost it, I was like was that it? So right now Im glad youre seeking help. What the others have said is take walk or start lifting. Im so glad I started lifting not only it help your health it also boosted your confidence. However, since all the gyms are closed right now Ill suggest just taking walks then start transitioning into running. Also, like another redditor had said to start worrying about your looks as well. Girls actually see that, if you cared about how you dress/groom yourself. It shows that how you actually present yourself as a person. I highly suggest going to therapy to get your mental health back on track as well. At the end of the day, is the fact youre trying to better yourself. Since the gyms are closed, I hope you join one once this all blows over. I know you may feel intimidated at first, but honestly people dont care about what you look like or do. Since they are there to workout and move on with their day. Because at the end of the day youre there to better yourself. If they say something about you they can go fuck themselves. I met a lot of friends from the gym. Also, one last thing is during this time find a hobby and start branching and find people with similar interests. Then build a connection with them and you never know that you might find that someone and it blossom into something more. I suggest trying to find three hobbies that helps you be creative, money, and being healthy. I as would like to suggest a book to read as well. Its called The subtle of art of not giving a fuck by mark Manson. Truly a really good book on developing a better mindset. You got this I believe in you. This whole subreddit got your back. We believe in you brother!"
"Focus on who you want to be. What do you want to look like? What's your ideal life? Then break that down into the different areas - looks, athleticism, career, family. Start with looks - do you want grimey teeth and to weigh 130kg? No? Then brush your teeth twice a day and start weight loss. There are steps you can take for each one, you just need to focus on you and don't make it all about your virginity. PS Also fellow misophonia sufferer here and it's the absolute worst thing. It is almost impossible to describe to non-sufferers how it impacts your life. Happy to talk about it if you need any support."
"Step 1, get into a routine of grooming and hygiene. Shower daily, brush your teeth and wash your face twice daily, floss (use floss sticks if it makes things easier), wear deodorant, shave/trim your beard and cut your hair to a style that suits you. The key stereotype of neckbeards is poor hygiene, if you want to break out of it then get that hygiene under control. Bad hygiene is something that people will unanimously judge you poorly for and for good reason, take that away and youre already leaps and bounds better off. Step 2, start dieting and exercising. Quarantine is one of the best times to do this. There are tons of how to guides for heavier people who may have a hard time with exercising, itll show you where to start and build yourself up. Remember, its a lifestyle change not just a temporary thing. Its good for your health though, so it for health first and looks second. Finding a job and working on social anxiety will be hard right now. For your anxiety that might require therapy, Im not a professional but it sound like you may have an actual anxiety disorder. Read the book Overcoming Shyness and Social Anxiety by Gillian Butler, its a book thats given to social anxiety sufferers by doctors in the UK. Itll help you understand your thought patterns better and be a good how to guide on facing your fears."
"tl;dr: Exercise is by far one of the most irreplaceable methods of improvement and self-love, with one of the best guaranteed return for your investment. Whatever you may think you are, it's better to be that AND fit. ----- Self-discipline is unique and has no substitute. There is no other way to do something than to just do it. Whenever you feel like not doing what you should, try this: acknowledge to yourself this emotion and then simply *do it anyway*. The best time to start is twenty years ago, the second best time is yesterday. To address your specific examples: > I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside Pursue proper hygiene for your own benefit. It's much better to exist in a physical husk that is clean and smells nice. Also, you don't get another body and teeth aren't going to grow back. Even from a financial perspective you are saving money with good habits. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. > Im on Disability Welfare It's a tool. Use it to attain the point of the tool: progressing past needing it. > I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient. Reflect on what you could've done differently. Try that. Reflect again. Repeat. The only real mistake is not learning from your mistakes. > Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. Bro. Literally throwing money in the trash is better than spending it on egirls. There will always be more women for you out there, there will not be more yourself for you. Spend the money on your own self-interests instead. Basic exercise equipment, healthy whole foods, clothes that fit, fundamental hygiene accessories, etc. > I am 130kg This is one of the most salient areas of improvement right now. You don't need to leave the house to start living healthier. Drink enough water, get enough sleep, eat enough protein + vitamins/minerals, and AT LEAST one hour of exercise a day. Day 1: sufficiently taxing cardiovasular activity (lay down and bicycle pedal if you have to) and Day 2: strength training. Repeat. Eat less calories than you burn to lose weight. You can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. > I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood. GOOD. Harness that. > The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic. Therapy and hard work. You can get past that. > Finally, I wonder if this is even possible? Turning 26, never got remotely in a close relationship in my entire life and being an autist I really worry to see that I can get more mature than identically a 12yo You could spend another quarter of a century being unproductive and STILL have more than enough time to turn your life around. You are still at the beginning of creating who you are, the finish line isn't even remotely close to being visible. The most important thing is to structure this progress. Don't overwhelm yourself with impossible goals and then get dejected when they don't work out. All you need to do is NOT do nothing, even if it's just one thing per day.

"The RedPill on Propaganda in democratic countries from an immigrant from an ex-Communist country using anti-Chinese Propaganda as an exposeeMany in the West claim ""our Press is free and fair and is not controlled by the government and therefore we have NO propaganda!"". I am here to show you how wrong this is. Coming from an ex-communist country, my propaganda detector is well honed. The Propaganda machine in the West is far more insidious than that of a ""totalitarian"" nation. While a ""totalitarian"" nation may blatantly repress dissenting speech and thus make the dissenters look like martyrs, the West - under the guise of free and fair press and under the guise of democracy can shape and influence public opinion and few will be the wiser as there is no blatant repression of speech and thus no obvious tyranny to resist. Furthermore, repressing overt nationalism further aids the propaganda machine, as any anti-country news will be viewed as ""objective"" because it is not overtly nationalistic. But ironically this conception plays into peoples need to identify with a tribe, and people do so subconciously while being able to feel good about themselves that they are non-nationalistic and a fighter for ""democracy"" and ""freedom"". Why do I write this? Today I have received a blatant anti-chinese propaganda newspaper on my doorstep, from a previously unknown newspaper that is encouraged by the municipal government. Since we on the redpill are concerned with truth, we should not only be seeking truth in terms of women, but also truths of the world and how the powers that be are attempting to influence our perceptions indirectly. As an unassimilated immigrant it is much easier to see and fight back against attempted mind control, not only because I have seen this in my own country but because I am already distrustful of the culture as a whole. Attached I present you the first page of this propaganda piece. Not only does the paper present an anti-china stance, it is also an expos on how language is on how language is manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata. It almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-chinese propaganda occuring and it progressively ramping up. It seems to me that the Western governments do not want this crises to go to waste and are looking to bring down the greatest threat to the Western rule since the fall of the USSR if not since ever. China is poised on the brink of becoming the new world leader and to wrest control of the world from the United States - if it weathers this storm, I think it will become unstoppable manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata. It almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-Chinese propaganda occurring and it progressively ramping up.

China is poised on the brink of becoming the new world leader and to wrest control of the world from the United States - if it weathers this storm, I think it will become unstoppable. https://imgur.com/a/mbVGhat The Western method of propaganda and influence of the population works in much the same ways that TRP suggests one influences women, through insinuation, implication and plausible deniability - never through direct statement. This is why the Soviet propaganda machine was inferior to that of the US, it operated on absolutes rather than insinuations (at least internally - it was much more effective externally). I recognize this method of propaganda, because this is how the KGB ran its own Propaganda campaigns in Western countries, creating fake papers and journal articles to influence western governments to believe in the possibility of nuclear winter and thus make the idea of nuclear disarmament more plausible. I write this as a warning to all of you living your daily lives, just as you are wary of women and the bluepill regarding them, be aware that much of the same techniques are used to control and influence your thoughts regarding the political situation in the country. Also, think whether this control is actually in your benefit, because if it was, would there be a need for propaganda campaigns?"
"I subscribe to that propaganda, for real. Imagine the situation now IF that chinese individual did not ate bat."
all the facts point to the virus being planted in the market by us soldiers in wuhan at end of october.
"And in other news: Earth is flat, the Moon spins around the Sun, Hilter did nothing wrong, etc. You know you talk about China, right? You know that China observs every citizen that walks on streets on major cities via cams and secret police, right? You know that you talk about communists in a favorable light, right? Man, the global health organization concluded that Covid 19 is from bats, China loves eating bats and other wierd things. Also China hid the virus as much as possible because of political reasons. P.s. I am european."
"You do know that every citizen is observed in major cities via cameras on every street corner and drones flying above cities in the USA? You do know that every text message is read and archived by the NSA? And all im seeing is china doing better socially and economically than the West, so how exactly is Communism bad, unless you've been told to believe it? Your understanding is a black and white comic book understanding, with Capitalism/individualism/liberalism being the Avengers and Communism being Thanos. There is far more nuance to that. Further, if everything you know about women is false (thats why you are on TRP), what makes you think everything else is true? (Especially such contentious topics like communism). The global health organization, is not gonna admit that the coronavirus is a us bioweapon (come to trp.red, there is much evidence for that there) considering that US is the main source of funding for the WHO."
"1.Communism is bad: Starving people, killing people, propaganda, censorship, cult of personality, eliminating classes, creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only, no opposition, collectivisation, Godlike strict rules (you can not pass a red light as pedestrian otherwise -good citizen score, wtf?), the ""new man"", dictatorship, etc All of those were present or are present in China. Extra: I am aware that some things are present in republics also but too few. If you are a fan of a dictatorial, strict, severe regime, by all means, go and live in China but do not run their propaganda agenda. I preffer to live in a roman republic( most democracies are based on the roman republic model) than a communist system even tho I preffer the greek republican model. Of course, ancient. 2. Kinda hard to believe that there are drones flying in USA to monitor you or NSA archieving literally all text messages and listening to all your phone calls. As I said, I am european and I do not know why you bought the USA drobe, NSA, gov stuff on table. This subject outclasses me. But again, kinda hard to see USA doing it, it would result in a more responsable society I imagine. 3. China is doing better economically, yea, in some areas facing starvation, poverty and other stuff like that. If it is as you say, would you also add the argument that Germany under A.H. was an economical power also? 4. Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy. That's not an argument why commie is good and it works. 5. The GHO is a buch of clowns that run things on paper and not in reality. Examples: spanish flu, ebola, Covid 19, etc. They are kinda useless in my personal oppinion. I am waiting for your counter arguments and also, can you provide me the links that state your theory that US soldiers planted the virus in Wuhan? I would like to read it. Thank you for your possible future response."
"> Communism is bad: Starving people, so the millions starving due to poverty due to the existence of capitalism and socioeconomic class everywhere in the world is okay, but communism causes starving is bad? look you are romanian, surely you know what happened to post-soviet states after the ussr fell - how crime, poverty and hunger exploded over night? capitalism causes far more deaths than it helps. also, the only reason europe has a good lifestyle under capitalism is it exploits poorer countries for their resources. also, under both soviet and chinese communism, their goal was to eliminate starvation and give everyone access to food >killing people, right and capitalism doesn't start wars over oil or resources for the benefit of a few? I'm sure syria and libya would beg to disagree >propaganda, censorship, I have shown you in OP how capitalist/democratic systems engage in propaganda/censorship. if you really think that there is no propaganda in the West, you're delusional >cult of personality, how is raising someone as an example for people to follow bad? This is literally what happened throughout all of human history through figures like odysseus/or skaldic bards. >eliminating classes, so giving everyone equal opportunity to succeed is somehow bad? isn't this precisely what europe is doing now anyway? >creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only capitalism creates a rich elite devoted to money only, that allows them to justify traitorous immigration laws, avoidance of tax, unbeneficial laws, etc. >no opposition, all of the opposition in western countries is controlled, because any opposition that threatens the status quo is either shut down through concepts like 'hate speech' or the powers that be do everything to discredit it. how is that any different from what the communists do? >collectivisation and why exactly is collectivization bad? collectivization protects the individual from harmful influences, gives him a goal to live towards and protects him from the consumerist nihilism present in the modern world. in fact, collectivization would solve many western problems from the opioid epidemic, to obesity, to feminism to male suicide. collectivization is holding people to a standard necessary for survival/prosperity. if you oppose it, you oppose standards, which means you want to stay mediocre making you essentially bluepill >Godlike strict rules (you can not pass a red light as pedestrian otherwise -good citizen score, wtf?), the ""new man"", dictatorship, etc so what you are saying is you are opposing social order? Why is social order a bad thing? >I preffer to live in a roman republic( most democracies are based on the roman republic model) No most democracies are not based on the roman republic model. the roman republic model is actualy close to the chinese ruling system, where a small cadre of men (the senate or in china's case the politburo) make decisions and then execute them. western nations are a twisted form of athenian democracy. >Kinda hard to believe that there are drones flying in USA to monitor you or NSA archieving literally all text messages and listening to all your phone calls. As I said, I am european and I do not know why you bought the USA drobe, NSA, gov stuff on table. This subject outclasses me.

If it is as you say, would you also add the argument that Germany under A.H. was an economical power also? just because there is poverty in some places in china does not at all take away from its economic achievements. it has singlehandledy raised hundreds of millions out of poverty and continue to raise millions more every year. And yes, germany was an economic miracle under AH >Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy. That's not an argument why commie is good and it works. capitalism exists in many places of the world - brazil, belize, cote d'ivore, democratic republic of congo, etc and they are all doing poorly economically - does that mean that capitalism is a failure? >can you provide me the links that state your theory that US soldiers planted the virus in Wuhan?

"Ooook, so, let's begin. 1. There is a difference betweet starving because of commies and capitalism. In capitalism, you have a real canche to get out of poverty, in commie, no. 2. Commies also start wars so, no strong point there. Taiwan? Tibet? Butan? Hong Kong? 3. Your ""propaganda"" is not real. China is solely at fault for Corona. Look at their culture. They eat dogs, cats, bats, koalas, snakes, etc and thet try to eat it as raw as possible because it is considered healthy. Well, that backfired, did it not with Covid? In this case: eating bats is not a good thing. Some cultures are better than others. Still on propaganda: I can watch, listen and read pretty much everything in democracy, can even real Mein Kampf if I want, you can buy it but not in China. Media must he aproved by the gov first, not cool. The ""propaganda"" that you showed, it is in fact, reality. Sad to break your commie chinese love but reallity is reallity, just like TRP regarding woman. Get over the anger phase. 4. No, cult of personality is not raising someone as an example. Stop toying woth words, you start to sound like an SHW/Antifa. Cult of perso is when you are forcebly shoved in your throat a person. For example: Stalin, Hitler, Muso, Che, Fidel, the Kims of Korea, Hirohito in WW2, Mao, etc. 5. No, it is not bad, that's why we have universal free healthcare (at least in EU), free schools and colleges, police, firemans, housing program, car program. People are not born and will not be able to be all equals, have same chances, this is by default. You might be good at math but I really suck at it, for real. You might be bad at programming but I am a sharp tool in programming PLCs in Step7, TIA Portal and also designing electrical systems in Eplan. You and me are by default not equal. Equality in chanses, not really, again. Even with free healthcare, education and all, there can not be equallity. Stop this commie thinking please. Also, people do not like to be equals and the same. Not everyone wants a VW Passat, others want Seat Leon for example or Fiat. Also, you want to be equal with Elon but Elon does bot want to be equal with you. 6 capitalism creates them naturally and by that I mean rich people just became rich because reasons. Commies just creates artificial rich people. So you are a starter banker? If you are not in my close group of friends and not commie, nope, bye. The state wants you out of the elite plus you do not seems, subjectively, dedicated to the commie ideals. Sorry man but you are really losing this discussion. Commie is bad for culture, humanity, science, etc. Whatever. 7. What other political parties are in China? Is there a liberal party? Conservatorist party? And I am talking in EU politic terms (USA is garbage with politics). Nope, only commies and if you do not vote commies, you are a bad, bad citizen, off to reeducation with you. I am not in the USA sphere of thinking. We have opposition here that fights for it's causes. The democrat socialists were in power in Romania, they did terrible things and wanted to do more like pardoning people accused of corruption, fraud and money washing but the opposition managed to unite (liberals, technocrates, idk if i spelled it correctly, other socialist formation) and together with the people's protests, the social democrats felt. This is an example. China? Nope, no opposition, no protests, nothing. 8 Yes, I am romanian and collectivisation left a huge wound and scar in our society and for me also. My grand grand father owned a lot of land that was productive, he was working it but when the commies vame to power, he was executed because he did not want to give hi's private property to the commies. After 24 years of commie downfall, my family managed to get back only 60% of our rightful lands. No, collectivisation is not ok. It kills private innitiative, it keeps people poor, it keeps people in slavery, etc. Stop thinking red. You are in TRP and you come with all this crap? Obesity is because people do not care what and how much they eat. Suicide rates in males is mostly because they are pussies and not being able to man up. Feminism, how it has affairs in collectivisation? Yes, I oppose collectivisation so you can call me a bluepill beta male, I do not care. My wallet says other thing and the keys I have on my keyring also say other thing. Ask my lawyer also and he will say another thing regarding the rest of 40% of the missing property that will be gained back. 9. I will not comment on that, it just sounds so SJW retarded crap with social order. What do you even mean by that? Always explain yourself man when you are having a discussion with someone or an argument. Chill, I view this as a discussion and I would like to get more replies from you on this subject. Regarding my point made for Godlike strict rules: no, I would not like such a system that tells me how to walk, what to wear, how to interract with people, what hairstyle shall I have. The ""new man"" is bad because totalitarian regimes impose their view. In commie Romania, the commies envisioned that the new man (does not matter what sex you are) must be an engineer, architect, excellent at maths and exceptional scientists. There was no room for philosophers, artists, bankers, priests and other occupations related to those fields. Not good, a stable and functioning society needs everyone. From garbage collector, ticket seller, waitress, baker, banker, broker, aetist, philosofer, priest, stripper to engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc. 10. No, the roman republic =/= chinese republic. Do your homework please. USA, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK, Canada, Italy, etc are based on roman republics. China is just a dictatorship, a plain one. 11. No, there are no drones, spy camers, secret police, radar vans, etc in EU countries. In USA maybe, I do not know but in EU, nope. As I stated in this post previously, policits are totally different from USA and EU. Bernie is the only socialist in USA. The rest are conservators that are both in the left and right side which is impossible. Only Bernie can ve a lefty because socialism and communism in left. But again, I do not know much about USA politics. I view USA as being retarded. While the whole world uses metric system, they adopted their strange and confusing metrics in all aspects of life. Wtf is a yard, gallon, mile, inch, fahrenheid (i am sure i spelled it incorrectly), lefties, righties in USA? 12 Well, if China was so rich like you said, why it did not made a huge national program for all people to have electric cars? Heavely reduce air pollution, ban kid labor, not affording more thay 1 kid in family, etc. Nope, even tho China is an economic giant, it's people are still poor. Also, Germany's economy during A.H. was strong is fake. Nope, it was not an economic miracle. Hitler knew it and also he said it. That's one of many reasons he went to war, for hi's country not to economically fail in the next 5-10 years after '38. Please, just please, do not throw the ""but brah, da tankz"" because GE was not having that many tanks that others believed and also the tanks were crappy tanks. I would take a Sherman, Stuart, T34, SU, Firefly over any crappy Panther, Tiger, Toger 2, Elephant and also I would take a Spitfire and Hurricane over any german fighter until the jet ones. 13. Well, communism surely failed. It was present in so many countries during the Cold War and then it felt down. South America, Africa and other capitalist failed countries do not represent an against capitalism point. It is important to see how they failed also. I can say about Romania. It is a struggling capitalist country because 1. We did not know what capitalism is after 1989 so we are still learning what it is. 2. Our geopolitical position was against it. For cebturies we were invaded and razed by Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Austria. Can't really develop when your villages and small cities are razed, can you? 3. After 1989, people choosed neo commies and guess what neo commies did, they ruined the economy. Do you want details? I will give them if you want. In 2000, there was another chance. Between a nationalist, racist, commie hater, extremist and a commie hooligan, Romania choosed the commie. Vadim Tudor lost the elections because all ex commies allied against him and started a massive propaganda and spread fear (if he is elected, we all gonna die, executed, at gun point. He will lead us in chaos, dictatorship). The commies feared him because they knew that if Vadim would be elected, all ex commies would be shot, deported, jailed and monarchy would be reinstalled back in Romania under Michael the First. Can you provide more sources claiming that US soldiers planted the virus in China besides UNZ? As a resume: yes, commie is bad, no doubt in that and China created and exported Covid 19 by eating crazy stuff, more exctly in this situation: bats. I am not implying or advocating that China should be nuked, attacked with soldiers or anything but instead, China should apologise and take responsability for the situation and also stop being hyprocrites. Some cultures are just better than others my friend. Edit: you claim to be red pilled but you are against it with commie loving ideas. If you look at TRP ideas, values and way of thinking, well, those things would not be allowed in a commie state for both genders."

"Why are the caring loving fathers against their daughters being a housewife and dating an older man?If I follow the redpill ideology it says that the best thing I should do at 21, should be to stop going to uni, get married to a man 10-15 years older than me and be a SAHM. But my father was actually the one who wanted me to be an indpendant career woman, to have my own money, to study hard, and he say himself that he will never accept a guy whos more than 8 years older than me as a son-in-law. Hes not the only one, cause most of my friends that had a great relationship with their fathers seems to get the same advices which is studying, enjoying their youth, having their own money and then getting married to someone they love and theyre attracted to. My uncle literally hated his daughters boyfriend because he was overweight and short, which means that men are not against women dating chads when it comes to their beloved daughters Especially that its funny how most men hate being judged for their career, but theyre the first to look down on their daughters boyfriend if hes jobeless. The only fathers that are okay with their daughters having low standards usually turn out to be abusives parents and partners that dont give a shit about their offsprings, but most fathers who love their daughters seems to wants them to follow a path that contradict what the redpill wants for women"

"Hot take: Because they know they failed to teach you and prepare you to vet for the kind of men that is ok to be a SAHM/W with. They know that they made such a poor job that if you try to be a SAHM/W it is likely that you will pick a man that is incapable of doing his part or flat out evil. And since they still want what is best for you instead of teaching you right from the begginng they take the easy route and just tell you to avoid the risk. They didn't bother to give you the tools you needed to chase the path of the SAHM/W if you wanted it, so they just advice you against it. (All the previous sentences are using general you. I am not speaking about you personally) Also, I am portraying my opinion in an exaggerated way to make a point. Men don't teach their daughters how to look for good men."
"But why should a womans goal have to be about chasing a provider ? What if her husband leaves her, abuse her or die, and she have no education and no skills to support herself? Especially that having a High Value partner is not a thing that we can control, but its also a matter of luck."
"> But why should a womans goal have to be about chasing a provider ? There are no *""shoulds""*. A woman can do as she wants. Her goals are her own to decide. > What if her husband leaves her, abuse her or die, and she have no education and no skills to support herself? That is the risk she takes with the benefits that being a SAHM/W brings. It is on her to decide if the benefits are worth the risks. I know I would consider them worth it if I was a woman. > Especially that having a High Value partner is not a thing that we can control, but its also a matter of luck. This is kinda of a joke but what you said sounds like a woman that was not teached how to vet for a good man. Sounds like a father failed somewhere."
"Because fathers know the depths of male depravity and aren't beholden to groupthink when it comes to their daughters. It's a delicious bit of irony that a good father is gatekeeping by example vs the low effort hordes who think all men are on the side of women as fuck toys. They'll deny it, but they circle jerk women with daddy issues as easy fucks too much to be believed."
"Excellent point. My father is the same - an amazing man who always supports me to reach my full potential as a human being irrespective of my sex. He wants me to work hard for myself and my development, have a fulfilling career, travel the world, have a beautiful life. Hes disapproved of my past bfs who were not real go-getters. He wants a man for me that he himself can respect. This is true love from father for daughter. I would never accept anything less from a boyfriend either. Ill only marry a man who wants the absolute best for me as a human being irrespective of my being a woman."
"People are inherently self-interested. People do what serves their best interest. &nbsp; When men are young, they want what they want and convince women/spread the ideology that what they want is the best thing for women. It benefits them here. Themselves > potential female partner. However, when they have their own daughter, they care about her deeply and understand seeing a woman as more human - this woman is an extension of themselves. Themselves>extension of self>other men. &nbsp; And men know deep down what male nature is like, they understand that what they may have promoted in younger years isn't actually the best thing for a girl. Now, they change what they promote because now protecting their daughter serves their best interest, therefore promoting women's well-being/independence serves their best interest. Whereas before, getting a woman was in their best interest, therefore discouraging women's independence was in their best interest."
"Because having an old husband will benefit mostly this husband, not woman, and they know it. He will want kids quickly and you will have less chances to do the things you love, like digital painting, playing in a band, web designing, camping in Norway ect. Husbands hobbies and opinions would be more important, as he would have the money. Being dependent is not a good idea and they are aware of it."
"I think the optimal strategy for your daughter would actually be to get her to go to school for a decent career (nursing, engineering, doctor, lawyer, accountant, etc.), and when she's had 1-2 years career experience go for a man with a similar career 3-5 years older. &#x200B; 10-15 years is if you're a 20 year from a poor family with no career trying to leverage a young body into a lifetime of support, which, I wouldn't want for my daughter. &#x200B; And anyway it's not hypocrisy, reproduction and mating is a competition. Obviously I want the best for myself and children."
"Issues with dressing feminine and my boyfriend's reactionsHi RPW, I'm 18 and my boyfriend is 20. We have been dating for two years. I have been lurking the sub for awhile now and just recently (~4 months I'd say) switched my wardrobe from jeans, crop tops, and sneakers, to more feminine clothing such as dresses, heels, jewelry etc. This style change has made me instantly more confident and in tune with my femininity. I never thought I'd love dresses this much! However, I'm having a problem with how my boyfriend has reacted to these changes. It's not like he is telling me what and what not to wear - he says he likes me in everything. However, I've been having some self-esteem issues when it comes to his reactions. Whenever I wear tight leggings or jeans (I will every once in awhile now), he goes crazy over it and talks about how good/sexy I look. But I've noticed that when I wear my dresses that make me feel beautiful/feminine, he rarely ever comments. This is confusing me because here on RPW I keep reading that high value men appreciate a modestly dressed feminine woman, but I get wayyy more of a reaction from my bf when I'm at my least confident clothing-wise (jeans/leggings). Honestly, it makes me pretty sad. For instance, I came to his house the other day wearing my hair in a messy bun, leggings, a tanktop and a jean jacket, and he said ""Wow, you look like you took a few extra minutes to get ready this morning"" and I was instantly confused? Then when I wear a long, flowy dress and my hair down and makeup done CRICKETS It's driving me insane! Not sure what's going on here and I would love some insight! Thank you RPW!"
"It sounds like he prefers a more showy style. That's okay - there's no rule that says you must wear dresses and heels to be RP. In fact, many would say that it's appropriate to dress in a way that pleases your man. Have a chat to him about what styles he likes best, and see if you can find something that makes you feel good as well as that he finds attractive?"
Hes not into that look. Doesnt mean it looks bad or it looks bad on you... some guys just have a look they prefer thats all. ill be 30 next year..growing up i remember alot of girls in dresses. Nowadays? Dont see it too often. Maybe hes just not used to it. Its hard to guess..you gotta pry the answer out of him lol.
"He's not mature yet. He likes you looking like painted on clothes because he likes to look. That's it. Never dress for someone else. If dresses are you, wear them. If heels are you, find some proper fitting ones that have room in the front or risk bunions!!"
"When in doubt, always go with your mans preferences over this subs recommendations. Case in point, I love secrets of fascinating womanhood. The book recommends bows, ribbons, and other hair accessories. My man hates them and thinks theyre juvenile. I love them. I dont wear them around him but wear them when I wont be seeing him. Maybe try the same? Rock the dresses at work/school or with your girls. And with him wear what he loves."
"I think the most likely answer is the simplest one: he likes looking at your ass and he cant see it very well in flowy dresses. He can see it just great in tight jeans and yoga pants. Its okay for your guy to like looking at your ass and you show it off for him. You are 18, this is probably the best your ass will ever look! Enjoy your youth and beauty!"
Maybe a more fitted dress would suit both of your wants!
"Does your bf wear anything other than basic clothes? Lets face it. No dude with an ounce of taste or style will compliment jeans and leggings over a nice dress. This sounds like a case of you dressing up makes me look like a slob and I dont like it. Please be more mediocre If he is a jeans & T-shirt kind of dude, he is most likely having a subconscious reaction to your effort. You look all nice and dolled up and he is there in his plain clothes, so he appreciates when you look more basic."
So if this were the case how would I approach this? Yes he wears tshirts and basketball shorts quite often.
"Either he doesnt want you looking super feminine because he feels it will attract guys who can compete with him for you, or he just likes seeing your body more day to day."

"It's just a hang up People read too much into the past and into what others think. who cares? If are so hung up on a partners body count you are disregarding your own ability to recover too. Also people rely too much on ""science"" but only when fits the narrative. Truth is, there's nothing conclusive on the body count relation to LTRs quality [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606082607.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160606082607.htm)"

"Girls rejects you bc you're not the provider type ?So i fuck this girl first time and make her cum twice. Anyway, in next couple weeks she shows me some degree of interest by sending me pics of her in sexy dresses, but generally speaking when i msg her she takes 2 days to reply. Now normally i would just think ok she doesn't have high interest, but there's two things that make it interesting - she is 26. when we started talking i said i hinted i wasnt looking for anything serious, but she said she would be open to something serious. I said let's see how it goes. Note, she told me she has ridden the CC for the last 3 years, so I think she's looking for a provider now - I made a post on social media that very subtly hinted at me being financially well off, and soon as I posted that within 2 minutes she messaged me some naughty shit I get the feeling she's looking for beta bux provider and is playing games to see who falls for it. Thoughts?"
Seems like it. She's about to hit the wall (or has already) and trying to find a long term relationship to settle down. She's trying to secure that bag while relatively young before her options dwindle.
Bingo
Yes
">i said i hinted i wasnt looking for anything serious When you say something like this, a girl will by default feel like a loser if she's your something casual if she was raised even remotely decently. (Or even if like your girl, she was raised by the streets and is now wary of guys like you.) Maybe you say it because you want to be honest, or maybe you say it because it gets you off to emulate some FR you read on here. But realize that the game for a woman is commitment, and by outright shutting the possibility of her success down without supplanting it with a new fantasy (IE: How amazing being casual with you would be,) she ends up needing to do a lot of emotional labor to hamster what she's doing with you. Tl;dr: Girls try to beta bux every guy they meet unless you give them another frame to operate in."
>FR whats FR?
"Dangle the carrot of commitment instead of ""hinting you dont want anything serious"" U tryna smash or nah Basic playa shit 101."
"or never really talk about it, get her attracted, then you drop the the bomb or stay vague...and stay vague especially in your actions!"
"Yeah, that's exactly it. She was down to fuck (alpha fucks), but when you expressed not feeling any commitment, she bounced to continue her search for the nice guy (beta bucks). And she's 26 which is around the time many women start to think about their future."
maybe you didn't make her cum
"Society works best when the base assumption is men and women do deserve sex and relationshipsI see it posted around here often that particularly men, but women also, arent entitled to sex and relationships. I dont believe this is true. I think society functions best when the base assumption is everyone is entitled to being loved, having sex and enjoying at least one relationship. I find it alarming that in a culture where we obsess about the health and welfare of the environment and animal kingdom, we care so little about each other and our collective mental health and happiness. The superficiality and cruelty that define the dating market should be beneath the type of people we believe ourselves to be. Incels of both genders should have access to legal prostitution and both men and women should be encouraged to be less shallow and more generous in their dealings with each other. So many people now end opportunities for happiness because theyre not getting 100% of everything on their list, mostly women. This dull, checklist-style approach to dating sucks all the fun out of interactions for both genders and leaves many on the sidelines who are good people and would make good partners if others could just get over their superficiality. In short, I think the current state of dating is sad, cruel and shallow, and the idea that only the most shiniest people deserve love is a big reason behind it."

no
"I would say that societies work best or only work when the base assumption is that every man has a viable chance and path to get sex, a wife and children. That is what keeps men's productivity high and the economy running. When enough men stop being productive everything goes to shit. It has nothing to do with what people assume they deserve. It has to do with what men believe , if they have the chance and viable path to earn."
I think it only fair that women have the same base assumption too. Were one big family and we should be looking out for one another.
For women more than an assumption is close to a reality. But the argument is that societies work best under X situation. And history proves that societies can work when women don't have rights so... lets say that the assumption that women get sex is a given.
Not just sex but relationships too. I think everyone is entitled to them.
No. That idea is why we have transexuals who think straight men and women must be with them. It's why fat women think men must accept them. Its why migrants rape. Its why women who hit the wall think they have a good chance of having healthy babies. No one deserves sex or relationships unless you are willing to put in the work to get it. You have a typical millennial lazy unrealistic view of things.
"Best, on-point style guide I've read here. Vincent Cassel style reference? Damn, you have a good eye son."
My wrap around reflective surf sunnys are smoother than a fresh jar of skippy.
"Solid, practical write-up with good examples. I was going to recommend [The Appearance of Power](https://www.amazon.com/Appearance-Power-Masculinity-Expressed-Aesthetics-ebook/dp/B0778QQWQC), and it's worth a read if for no other reason than to internalize its underlying message of ""clothing is communication"" - but I like your approach better. It's much easier and probably a better use of time to simply emulate those you admire and adapt from there than get into finding out what your archetype is, etc."
That was a lot of words. When you can just go on IG and follow a mens fashion account you like. But you do you.
Haven't read this yet but I can tell it's good so gonna read it later in my onesie.
"+1 and saved to read again. Damn, it's been a while since I've updated my wardrobe. I changed a lot of my clothing when I started mrping, but now those things are getting old. More important is the disconnect between value and appearance, which you talk about. When we realize that dressing well communicates that we give a fuck, are worth it, and have the self-awareness to do all this - well, then we don't want to be seen in our shitty sweatpants, even when we're just home with our families. (instead, I upgraded to tapered track-style cotton pants, with a fitted t-shirt in a solid color for 'pajamas'). >""Men wear jeans from the last good year of their lives"" That's a quote from a friend of mine that has stuck with me for years. Doubly true if your wife picked them out for you."
"Does anyone else have a hard time finding shirts that fit? Large fits my shoulders, chest, arms and torso length, but assume you're a fat fuck in the middle. Mediums are better in the waist but often too short in the sleeves and torso."
"Find a shop that sells shirts by collar size. Buy slim fit (you're not fat, right?) and get the right collar size. Unless you've got some outlandish body shape else should fit. Don't buy shirts that come off the shelf as S, M & L unless they're polo shirts."
"Tailoring is key, even for casual shirts. If your body fucking rocks, spend some money and show that shit!"
"LTR hits me with When are we getting married?Been seing this girl for almost a year exclusively, and before anyone asks why im in a relationship, well, I promoted her after plating 3 different ones. This is a keeper.. for now atleast. Shes always been keen on having me move in with her, asks around about serious stuff which Ive always just laughed off or avoided all together. However this morning she hits me with the When are we getting married? bomb. She had a grin on her face and had this false joke of a tone which instantly gave away that she was indeed 100% serious. Now, Im obviously laughing in my head and I couldnt possibly go down that road so I told her We can do it whenever you want, I just need to notify my other girlfriends and see if they are okay with me settling down. Afterwards I would just dodge the bullet, but I have a feeling shes always gonna be looking for my ultimate commitment both by moving in with her and ultimately marrying her, which I obviously have no intention of doing. Is there a way to keep these comfort tests fed without having to actually give in to such nonsense? Do I give her a false idea that I actually will marry her one day?"
How old are you guys ?
"Thats the real question. OP, I personally like to be upfront about it if they ask me and put the burden on *them* to see if they ~~are willing to waste their time~~ can get me to fold or not (they cant), and if they wait too long to ask the question - say, two years or so into the relationship - then I throw the burden back on them for not raising the question earlier. Moral hang ups? Neither route is disingenuous nor misleading, so nothing to sweat there. One year into an LTR is too early to be pushing for marriage/moving in to ***her*** place in my view. If shes in her late 20s or older, this is characteristic of a girl rapidly approaching the wall and to be expected (of her). Even if shes younger, she sees something in you thats made her highly interested in making a serious push for you to be a provider in her life. Expect the ultimatum from her to drop no later than a year from this date if you stay with her and dont make it clear where you stand."
"(A) is the only one to give you any sort of control. For (B) she can just say ""I'm ready!!! :-)"", and for (C) she can start counting them. Source: similar ex LTR"
"A. Yes. B. *""You're ready when I decide you're ready.""* C. 1500 sammiches, is one sammich a day for more than 4 years. He can always dump her at sammich #1499."
"I personally think one year isn't long enough. 2.5 or 3 years of dating would be enough to propose to someone. Ive dated girls for over a year and we barely have any fights. You need to see your gf at her worst, pissed the fuck off and furious at you. You gotta go thru her phone and verify she hasn't been flirting with any guys while you've been dating. You've gotta meet her parents and figure out if they're gonna make shit harder for you or not. Lots of shit goes into marrying a girl. One year tho? That's kinda early. I'd say deflect the shit out of it. You can always be truthful and say you want both of you to be making good money first. Another important factor is kids. Do you want kids? If so, do you think she would be a good mother? They often say that kids have the worst traits of your partner. Lots of questions maeng."
"I tell my girls I won't get married because I don't like the stuff. So if they want to stay with me, they must work every day, not only until we get married. Until they push more and you just move on to the next one"
Lol OP unless you plan on having kids LTRs are a beta male strategy. You avoid them especially bc of situations like this. You don't need an LTR to solve the male sexual imperative.
"She wants to get married, you can only dodge it for so long before it will end up being a problem. This is why a lot of mgtows/red pillers avoid LTR's since it's the middle path to eventual marriage and having kids."
"Alexandra Stein on Disorganized Attachment in Cults Totalitarian RegimesDid anyone look into Cults and TRP? The more I research into cults and how cult indoctrinate people, the more I see the parallel between TRP and cults. Here is a very eye-opening podcast on cults and how it functions. [https://numinouspodcast.com/episodes/tnp121-alexandra-stein-on-disorganized-attachment-s1!43cca](https://numinouspodcast.com/episodes/tnp121-alexandra-stein-on-disorganized-attachment-s1!43cca)"
"Having been in a religious cult I have researched a lot about cults and Alexandra Stein is one of my favorite cult experts. I am not an expert on TRP and I am new to all these pills lol. Many cult experts have predicted that with the growing accessibility of the internet, cults are going to go mostly online and be more difficult to identify.Gone are the days of a cult being a group of people locked up in a compound. So I wouldn't be surprised if TRP checks most of the boxes. Check out r/cults If you haven't read 'The True Believer-Thoughts on the nature of mass movements' by Eric Hoffer I am sure you would enjoy it. Also there are two videos on YouTube about the psychology of cults by Leo of actualized.org. He does a great job of summarizing information about how they work and what makes people drawn to them."
"I used to date a Red pill guy - untill he dumped me for being ""too serious"" and ""wanting a family"" (Directly disproving everything they preach) I used to date a guy that was obsessed with 4chan..so that's why I know everything about the red pill etc...all of their theories about women.. I even got a bit brainwashed and started believing him.. Not just about the pill but everything else that they believe on 4 chan/pol.. I think I've been a pretty good girlfriend..loyal, madly in love with him, did all the housework, I love cooking and baking, got along with his friends and family, big boobs, always wearing dresses and makeup.. fulfilling all of his sexual fantasies (even though most of them hurt me and I really didn't enjoy them).....you name it.. I was basically the ""red pill fantasy girl"" I even made sure we split the bills equally, eventhough he earnt more money than me.. You know what happened?? This ""Red pill"" ""traditional"" man, was the one that dumped me! And you know what was his reason?? That I'm ""too serious"". In his words precisely: ""I know you want to settle down, and have kids in a couple of years..and I'm not ready for this"" (he was in his late 20s / almost 30 if that matters) He also said he wanted to try dating other women - basically seeing if he can find someone hotter. So here you have a real life example of the Red pill men.. Uncapable of emotions..only caring about looks..and not willing to raise a family.. I loved him, was willing to drop everything for him, settle down,.. And he's the one that wasn't ready.. Red pill is the worst thing that has happened to me... I can't believe I fell for it...I lost almost all of my friends over it as well, because I defended my ex and his beliefs about genders / race... Until that happened...and I realised it was all bullshit...I can't believe he's still a part of that community after what he's done to me... All of this has pushed me in a hardcore depression... I'm starting to doubt men are even capable of having feelings... Anyway...just wanted to get this off my chest.....this was my wake up call...and now I'm trying to fix years of being brainwashed.. TL; DR: A red pilled man dumped me for being ""too serious"", and ""wanting a family"" sometime in the future.."
How long were you with him?
"1,5 years. Luckily not longer. I guess the hormones wore off and he no longer felt excited around me.. But what bothers me the most is that he got me in my best years. They claim a woman's value sharply declines after age 25.. Which means he knowingly lead me on and stole my youth from me.."
"> They claim a woman's value sharply declines after age 25. That is not at all true, and unless you dove into meth and alcohol at age 25 you would not notice a decrease in your ""value"" one bit. Go live a happy life and forget this dork."
"Anyway, I apologise to everyone reading this. I know it was mostly a rant, but I thought it was ironic how he basically commited all the sins they blame women for.."
"It's tough at the end of almost any partnership, and becoming rapidly alone absolutely sucks, but this was a bullet dodged. &#x200B; In your post, you convey that you did a lot of things for your partner's sake that you didn't enjoy, that you were brainwashed by his ideology, and that you isolated yourself from friends. &#x200B; That translates to: You were willing to push aside your own boundaries and discomfort, put aside your ability to critically evaluate his ideology, and isolated yourself from other sources of stability and insight. It might sound silly, but almost all of us at some point in our lives are willing to do just that when: 1) We're in situations where we don't have much experience, or 2) We have some things about ourselves which cause us to feel insecure and willing to not respect our own wants and needs. The important part is to spend time learning more about yourself and figuring out if it was inexperience or insecurity. If it was mainly inexperience, you can chalk this relationship up to the 'lesson learned' side. You will know to avoid a man like him in the future when it comes to relationships. If it was an insecurity, you'll continue to date the same kind of guy again and again until you strengthen, heal, and understand the things you feel insecure about. Sometimes RedPill guys are right when they disparagingly say 'All Women Are Like That'... and sometimes women are right when they say disparagingly say 'All Men Are Like That'. Not because what they believe is true, but because they live their lives in such a way that they filter out all the healthy people who are \*not\* like that. It's important to learn from this relationship so that you don't partner with another man like that and end up losing friends and disrespecting yourself. Being alone for a while sucks. Ending a relationship sucks. Losing friends sucks. But you really lucked out that this relationship ended. You now have awesome downtime to reflect and reconnect with some of the friends you lost along the way."
"Sorry to hear what you went through. But still, when you say "" I'm starting to doubt men are even capable of having feelings... "", I think that is a very BOLD statement! because you are basically generalizing here, have you tried ALL MEN to know that they don't have feelings?! SOME DO HAVE FEELINGS (if that's good or bad I still don't know myself)... I think this is a common cause of being ""too nice"" of a person and not getting the results you wanted/expected. Therefore comes the frustration. I, as a young man of 23 years old, am in the same situation. I had a breakup because apparently I was ""too nice"" for her and wanted to commit into a marriage and have children. By showing that I had emotions and that I deeply cared about her, I think I scared her away??!! (things just started going sour after I opened up to her). After this breakup, I got involved into TRP community and started buying into all their crap... Barely got to the point of hating all women because of their suppose ""hypergamy"" and all the mind games ""they play"" on us men... But after a while, I realized it's all BS. It just depends on the people you meet in your life and the way they think/see things. Let's break the cycle of generalization and hate towards the opposite gender. People are people, some click with you, others don't. Just appreciate the good moments and try to move on. My best advice is: Love yourself and then you might find someone who loves you back the way you are and is on the same page with your goals in life."
"I'm so sorry you went through that, but so glad to hear you are free and see through it all now."
:(

I wholeheartedly agree with you. Im glad someone other than myself doesnt define alpha with body count and doesnt pedestalize hook up culture.
"This is a really good advice. And yet so basic, simple and so much repeated: Improve yourself and enjoy life Easier said than done, but it all comes to this and base of your confidence, which is everything."
"This is very insightful. I think many men struggle with the fact that the only option seem to be to spin plates and then what? While spinning plates and such is obviously enjoyable, whats next? If you come from a traditional background, where marriage and parenthood are deeply rooted into your culture, then the red pill will be stuck in your throat for a long time."
"Love it. And agree, you will reap no reward for spending your time doing arm chair philosophy about the global sex economy."
"awesome post OP, your understanding of western society and the perspective looking from the outside in produce fantastic insight. I'm super interested in this documentary"
"So... you base your conclusion upon media that was produced with someone elses vision. Do you trust this entity which produced this? Society, women, media are nothing but wind that surrounds and influences your surroundings and ultimately revolves around you."
"When your Career=More InterestAm I the only one who gets annoyed when a girl is suddenly more interested when she finds out about your career? I realize they see this as an opportunity to score big and get beta bucks. But am I the only one who loses interest in a girl when that happens? Have had it happen a couple times where shes more eager to be in my life and shes always revolving things around my career/career ambitions. Always gets on my nerves and usually ends with me never contacting them again. Just curious to see if Im not alone in dropping that girl immediately or if anyone uses that dumb stuff to their advantage Edit: Just cause everyone is asking. Im in the field of law still finishing up my studying though. I like the comments so far. But Ill throw in a more specific example of when this has happened. Ill mention the career field and they suddenly ask what car I drive, type of house I want etc. Another thing is like when Im confident or vague they start saying like yah I can tell why youre in the field. What annoys me is that they are extra inclined to be in my life and suddenly everything I do is cause of my career lol. Its not a bad I guess. But its just off putting cause its just my career. Im really not the type to care about what field anyone is in cause Im not very judgmental. There is a plus side I guess. Talking about cases that involve like murder always gets a girl extra interested lol. So at least I always have a story. Also for the all engineers out there commenting. I started out as an engineer in uni but math was not my strong suit so switched to a law major but much love boys"
"She wants to be apart of your world. She sees you as a competent man. When this happens, shift conversation back to them and be vague about it. People love talking about themselves. You could always give her filler about it like oh, We do a lot of fun things like write about X. Id say more but, whats Y and change conversation. Set boundaries. If she breaks them, your choice."
What do you do bro? I'm a software engineer and I get the same thing.
I mean why would they be attracted to a loser ?
"I've had this happen. I have a good job, nice house, nice car etc. Women are pretty good at smelling success on a guy, even if he's dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. $$$ ups your RMV (but not your SMV) so might as well combine it with game and enhance your prospects."
Not me. Im a computer/software engineer. Girls seem to be turned off by it lol. I dont bring it up unless its asked explicitly
"Is female as a noun misogynistic?Hi there! I always feel uneasy when someone says females instead of women. For example, females are xyz or females do xyz. I feel like female is an adjective for any animal, like a female cat, a female elephant, a female human... and a female human happens to be a woman, so why not say woman? I feel like I mainly hear men saying it, and I dont hear the equivalent male. It sounds degrading in a way. Also, if thats relevant, English is not my first language and I may be missing a nuance. Would love to hear your opinions on this!"
I feel the same way! Im not sure why though...I know that doesnt help much
It does help! Good to know Im not imagining red flags
"Not inherently so, there are circumstances where using it is perfectly normal - but it is a red flag. But when one could just say ""woman"" or ""women"" (not always the case in English), and doesn't, it's not a good sign. There's a reason why the Ferengi in Star Trek use it that way. There's a weird focus on the sex rather than just a passing clarification like you get with ""women""."
"I think its kind of weird too. Im not necessarily sure if Id call it misogynistic (I guess it can be, but not under all circumstances), but to me it seems like when they talk about women by using the term females, its like theyre reducing us down to our gender. When you say women instead, it feels more like youre talking about them like theyre actual people, whereas I feel like the term female is somewhat degrading because of my previous reason. I feel like the terms men and women are more relaxed when talking about a group people of a certain gender. Its just kind of off-putting when people call women females to me."
"I like this explanation of it bringing it down to our gender, its exactly how I feel about it. Thank you!"
No problem! :)
"I don't think it's misogynistic, but I think there's a strong correlation between people who speak of ""men and females"" and people who are misogynistic."
"Referring to women as ""females"" is, to me, a signal that the person speaking that way does not have the best ideas about women."
"how mgotw and redpill made me fearful of women and how I got out.Howdy ladies and gentlemen. First of all I want to say that I never was an outright member of both movement. I agreed with some concepts and while I never fully drank the koolaid, it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology, I can finally say that I got it all out of my system. I write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that I've dealt with. # The beginning It all started when I was about 17/18-ish. During this time I used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there I would sometime read about people being screwed over, relationship wise. At the time I just thought ""shit happens"", but those posts would come again every now and then. My downfall really started on quora and reddit. A big difference between 9gag and these 2 Websites was that the posts didn't have character limits. Quora questions like ""how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you"" and subreddits like r/Relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people (usually men) would be cheated on in the worst way possible. I remember how I would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious. My current situation was as follows: Overweight, virgin, no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low. Just to make you understand how bad it was, I loathed and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and I almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone. # The redpill and mgtow This is when I started to discover the redpill. I watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits. In the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened. They said that Women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it, and everywhere I looked, I would just find more stories that would confirm what I've read and heard from this redpill people. Even though I was deep in the red pill, I still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group. You see, while I believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff, I still couldn't buy the ""all women are like that"" mentality, both from a logical but also an emotional point. i.e. the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men, but I never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators (as far as i'm concerned). I also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them I would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say. She would often spend money on him, she took interest in what he did, etc. If my sister was like that then it wouldn't have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed. To be completely honest I wasn't angry at women, I was scared of them. I was scared that I could be cheated on, that if I got married, they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and I would have raised a child that was not mine. To give you an example of how deep my paranoia went, I often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house, trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner's back just to be sure that I wouldn't not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over. # How I got out Well, to be completely honest it was a multitude of things. First thing first, I deleted reddit and quora. This places were tainted to me and even nowadays I get somewhat nervous if I enter these websites. The next step was actually going my on way. Instead of listening to bitter and resentful people, I slowly began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own. I started to hit the gym (lost 21 kg / 46 pounds) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt. More importantly, I started to be critical of my own beliefs. If I didn't have a sound logic to it, it had to go. Now I'm 20 and I'm far more calm and retrospective person. I'm still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend, but that's just what it is. I learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services. On Monday I will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest, I'm already shitting my pants, but at least now I know that I have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me. cheers. EDIT: I called. It went good. Nothing official because of the current situation, but I'm confident I will get the place. Cheers."
Awesome!
thanks. I'm glad you enjoyed my story.
"Now this is the real going your own way! Plenty of people start dating after 20, don't feel bad about it. Good luck with the internship!"
"I stopped feeling bad for myself the day I detoxed from all this internet cults. We are responsible for our own happiness. If we let other dictate how we feel we may as well say that we never really lived. Also, thanks for the encouragement. Luckily I worked for this company once before and we kinda made a verbal agreement that I could work there again, but with this pandemic nothing is certain. Thanks and take care."
"As a woman, this gives me hope"
"MGTOW is pretty dangerous for young men, because everything you read is the bitterness of older men in their 40s and 50s who got unlucky or made bad relationship choices. I'm seeing a wave of young men who lacked a father figure, usually only in their mid teens to mid twenties, already terrified of cheating and divorce. That isn't living at all. It's equivalent to if a young girl listened to the advice of an old spinster wine aunt proclaiming all men are trash and ""don't bother finding live""... it's just shitty advice from an old person who's becoming irrelevant and too old to be cool at clubs and parties. When you're 20 you have your whole life ahead of you, don't let it be dictated by a bunch of old fucks who gave up."
"Getting divorce rape is not a bad relationship choice. The young girl is gonna be succesful at dating all her youth, the young boy maybe not"
"20 is extremely young. Youre not even old enough to drink or rent a car. Focus on your health, stacking money, meeting new people, travel, living life, and following YOUR dreams. Once you get to where you need to be as a person, you will be surprised at the kind of quality you attract in your life. You have nothing to be afraid of when it comes to jobs and dating. You are just as deserving as anyone else. You are just as valuable as anyone else. Interviews, dates, relationships etc works both ways. Sometimes you have to ask yourself do I like this person? instead of will they like me? Im glad you are done with the fear, insecurities, and RP junk. You dont have to con or trick people to get things or be overly paranoid. Just have boundaries and self respect. Congrats on the weight loss by the way. Thats a huge accomplishment. Get that internship next."
"My husband didnt have a girlfriend until he was 20, also. That doesnt mean anything. Youll be fine as long as you keep an open mind and open heart."
"How do I become more receptive to feminism? I hope this question makes sense, but just a short explanation of what I mean. I'm a guy in my early twenties, I'm going to university, and I've been trying to change recently, so I also started reading up on feminism. Now, I've always been generally left-wing, but when I read a feminist critique for example, I sometimes become quite dismissive. What I mean but that is that I think things like: ""That's ridiculous/not true"" ""Oh, so that's a problem too?"" ""Seems like everything is an issue"" But when I think about the points, I was so eager to dismiss, some more, I'm more open to them and usually understand where they're coming from. However, that first impulse is really weird. It's sort of like I'm realising that I've been benefitting from some of the problems women face in society, simply because of how society is set up, and my brain doesn't want to admit that because it's easier for me to ignore everything and act like I've done nothing wrong and that everything is fine and dandy? I have a hard time writing my thoughts down in English, so I hope that I was able to make myself clear."
My mother always said the first thought you have about something is often the thought society wants you to have/ the thought you were conditioned to have. It is the second thought that shows who you are. I asume it will get easier after a while to distinguish between what you think because of prejudices and what you really think. Your thought process seems normal to me :) Keep asking yourself uncomfortable questions!
"This reminds me of innuendo studios' video series Why are you so Angry? He made a few points about how, when you learn something that might make you look bad, your immediate impulse might be to reject it. For example, someone saying ""I can't eat that because I'm vegan"" might make you feel judged so you will react negatively. Even if the vegan doesn't care what you eat, you might feel like their actions present an idea that, if true, could mean that you have been doing something bad for most of your life: eating meat is bad. This makes you feel guilty and judged so you reject the idea and mock the vegan. This is explained much better in Innuendo Studio's [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU&list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF&index=3&t=0s) but that's the general idea. The video is part 2/6, so sorry if it doesn't make sense without the context of part 1. Hopefully this helps :)"
"It does make sense, thanks a lot!"
"You're having a defensive reaction to having your assumptions about the supposed normalcy and okayness of the way things are challenged-- it's a normal reaction as the brain works pretty hard to resist things that significantly change our views of the world and/or self. In this case, what is being challenged is your sense that you aren't complicit in the oppression of the women around you, and it's difficult because you've never thought about it before and it feels threatening to be confronted with the truth. Just keep reading, and acknowledging (but not necessarily accepting as right) your feelings, and those feelings will start to fade as you learn more."
"I dont know what your first language is but I find when I coach that younger people do well with reading a little of the second sex by Simone de Beauvoir. It gives you an intro, encourages you to think differently and gives some context around the theories of feminism. Hope this helps! You seem to be smart and on the right track too :)"
"I'll check it out, thanks :)"
"Check out Philosophy Tube on Youtube! He has some fab recent videos, but his older educational videos more specifically about feminist philosophy are brilliant and very easily digestible. I really recommend. (He also has some amazing more generally left wing videos.)"
"I'll make sure to check him out, thank you"
"When I started unpacking my racism (i'm white and from the USA) I had a very similar reaction to what you describe. It's our brains trying to protect our bias and worldview. It's a very normal reaction, and that doesn't mean it's a good reaction. Become familiar with that feeling and try to observe it. Try to understand the issue from the other person's view - ask yourself, ""How would i feel if it happened to me?"" Also understand that criticisms of the patriarchy are not personal attacks. Just like when people call out racism it is not a personal attack, it is making an attempt to shed light on a systemic issue. It is easy to take this stuff personally and let our egos get in the way. It's a long and worthwhile process to examine our biases!"
"Thoughts about gender-related insults?A friend of mine asked me yesterday if I thought an email she'd written sounded 'bitchy,' and it got me thinking about this. The friend is a feminist, if that makes a difference. Her choice of words took me aback a little because 'bitchy' isn't used often among the people with whom I hang out. I don't use it myself, but due to a general aversion to profanity or otherwise harsh language rather than any concerns about sexism. Upon reflection, though, I thought that 'bitchy' actually bothered me a bit rather than just surprising me. *Is* it sexist? 'Bitchy' only ever seems to be directed at either women or people perceived to be acting in a feminine or effeminate manner. Relatedly, the insult 'dick' (which I also don't use, but again not for sexism-related reasons) is pretty much never applied to women. However, something being statistically associated with only one gender doesn't mean it's necessarily sexist. It's not like I'd tell my friend she should stop using the term, but I am curious about feminists' views on gender-related insults such as this. Are they sexist? Or does nobody really care? It's quite possible I only took note of it due to great boredom rather than any actual hint of sexism."
It was sexist but I think in the general context has thoroughly been reclaimed by women ('resting bitch-face'). So I think it depends on context.
I love this thinking - reclaim!
"I agree that it was sexist, but sometimes its a learning curve regarding word usage and once you realise the power of words, then the change occurs"
My dad used to tell me when I was like 9 to stop being such a girl. I hated him for so long for it. I was surprised when I actually came out as a trans woman he didn't hate me for it. He has changed now but that insult is super sexist and I hate anyone who says it. I hate sexist insults in general and growing up my dad would make so many thinking it was okay when it's not.
"I think it is, and try to avoid using it to refer to anyone else. If they are choosing to reclaim it, that's entirely their choice. I like the word 'kvetch' instead."
"That's fascinating. Thank you for such an in-depth answer! My reasons for avoiding profanity in general are somewhat related to this, so I can definitely see how adding gender-related assumptions and stereotypes to the mix would amplify the effects... Your policy seems like a great idea, and I wonder how much other communities might benefit by adopting similar ones."
"To be honest, I deeply relate with one interpretation of her question. It's probably just that I've sat through one too many Women-in-Business, *How to be assertive without being aggressive* type workshops, but to me ""does this email sound bitchy"" = ""Can you help me figure out whether I've worded things in such a way that would be acceptable coming from a man, but because I'm a woman my professional expression is held to a much different standard of obsequiousness, and thus if I get this wrong I could be risking career consequences over something than men never have to worry about."" In that case, ""bitchy"" is actually the right term, as it's part of a family of words that society uses to classify behavior that is unacceptable in part because the person doing it is not a gender-conforming man."

"Freedom is one of the best things a man can buy, but many men don't buy it, and we can see the results right now, when many guys are looking at their empty bank accounts and wishing we hadn't spent the stupid money we did. Personally my #1 thing is that I wish I hadn't gotten married, but I did, cause I was an idiot, and I have paid. The value of money and the misuse of it are major themes today.

"1 in 4 men experience rape/ violence and/or stalking by an intimate patner - yet there are 2 mens shelters in US compared to 2000+ for women. Abuse is an awful crime and we must take a more fair approach when deciding how we offer resources to victims.This is not to downplay any abuse suffered by women. And there are myriad platforms this is discussed in. My personal take is not to gender this issue and to deal with violence in general (yes we accept there are gender differences, in this case actually a lot so we act differently AS APPROPRIATE and ONLY WHERE NEEDED but we tackle the issue AS A WHOLE from the outset, using gendered laws and terms only when there is a good reason). However, this is not a commonly held view. For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women. **This is not a ""feeling"" or a sentiment that you can deny by simply saying ""i don't so its not true, feminists do support men""** \- it is a cold hard fact, 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women as a result of where they have focused their attention in reality, biased policies and campaigns only focusing on women; multiple specific gendered domestic violence acts and laws yet always and exclsively for women alone. The soloution: either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it with cold hard ACTUAL change/ lobbying/ campagning/ funding/ (not just ""yeah men can be victims too we care"") OR they need to allow MRA's to approach the issue without the constanst blocking/ banning/ no platforming MRAs who do receive. Even the sheer outrage when we mention statistics. ***Legendary feminist ERIN PIZZEY opened the first battered shelter for women in the world. When she attempted to do so for men, many years later she received death threats and rape threats by other feminists. Domestic violence, was raised in the mens conference at the university of Cambridge. This event was savagely no platformed/ protested and by (some) feminists and they even played bells to stop the speakers from being heard.*** &#x200B; 1. Other points, is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states such as ""male assualts female"" which is a specific offence in some US states and commonwealth countries. Entirely uncessary, as it is covered under normal gender neutral law, and it makes no sesne why there should not be a ""female assualts male"" law or female assualts child and so on. 2. In countries such as Australia there are no mandatory courses abusers who are women who are domestic abusers on avoidin violence, yet there are for men against women. This is one of countless over sights and gendered centric approaches, that currently taget one gender only. 3. Either gender neutral violence acts (that of course leave room for even significantly different approaches to the genders, as it is very different) or specific acts that cover mens abuse, as there will be differences. 4. The law needs rapidly gender neutralisisng and services refocused so we avoid regular occurences were male victims who call the police are being arrested or leaving the home!

"The feminist steelman answer is... why don't you men solve this problem for yourselves? After all, though heavily oppressed, women organized to get this all done, lobbying the government. Why can't you? And that's a good question. Why do men have such a hard time gaining a foothold for charities and non-profits? Why are both conservatives and feminists so agreed that under no circumstances should welfare go to men? (I have my guesses but I don't know for sure.) I personally don't know if welfare for men is the answer. But we already have a billion dollars a year in VAWA funding for organizations that care almost exclusively for women despite literally decades of peer reviewed research showing the full picture of DV. ***A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.***"
"Thanks for your reply. Watch the brief videos in the OP, to see why no one does anything. That is real peoples reactions to the matter. In my opinion, it is also due to gynocentrism being prevelant in much of society, where women, children and dogs first attitude is applied. Also as I said, in the OP, there is severe resistance to raising this issue from protesting/no platforming to outright death threats. Legendary feminist ERIN PIZZEY opened the first battered shelter for women in the world. When she attempted to do so for men, man years later she received death threats by other feminists."
When men try to organize the feminists get the government to shut it down. That's why.
> Why are both conservatives and feminists so agreed that under no circumstances should welfare go to men? Huh? Are you claiming that men are exempt from food stamps and Medicare or something?
The answer is male disposablilty and lack of in group bias. Feminists never had to convince people that women suffering was inherently bad. Just show the bloody women and people get upset. Show a bloody man and half the population will make a joke and the other half will be disgusted with his weakness. Men have an innate need to protect women. Not men. Women have an innate need to protect women. Not men. So who does that leave that just honestly cares about men? Dogs. And unfortunately they can't vote. There's a reason so many women become MRAs or at least not feminists after having sons. They can't really sympathize with men as a group or even their husbands. But their own child suffering resonates with them.
"Thanky you for your reponse. Yes I reject the idea of toxic mascullinity. What you are describing I would attribute to Gynocentrism and also male disposability/ the gender empathy gap as the videos show. See the video below for toxic feminitiy - and YES it does lead to death and violence. I dont think toxic femininity should be gendered. Funnily enough, the few feminist who have agreed that toxic feminity exists again do not call it this, they blame it on the patriacrhy and at times call it internalised mysogony. If feminism continues to use such deregatory and bigoted terms such as toxic msaculinity, mansplaining, manterupting, etc then Karen, toxic feminity etc will inevitably also result, and we dont want either of these, yet currently we have it one way. Id rather not see the rise of the term femsplaining and FEMIslplaining (where feminists explain to men their lived experiences) Toxic femininty: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwOne6dYZLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwOne6dYZLg) &#x200B; Thank you for your support of the issue. As I said though, there is clear violent opposition to it by (some) feminsists and also society at large, also, as I gave clear examples of The is it 2 because some take men is irrelvant. It is still vastly different whether 2 vs 2000 or not (some, but sadly mainstream and the ones that actually matter) feminists, sadly are not ahead as you state, they have precisely created those gendered laws and issues in the first place: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhq13TVRGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhq13TVRGc) This is why it is very good that western feminists are not tackling issues in India or Saudia etc. (they wont anyway as it wil cause more probems for them, apart from say it is bad, but that is another debate) Anyway: ""There are many ways that sexism harms women in india, there are also many ways that the same sexism benifits women. There are also many ways in which sexism specifically harms men, and in many ways that that same sexism benifits them. To fix the issues in places like india, we need an egilatrian approach, or we dont need a name for it just a global approach that solves issues of both genders and not one way.... For example in Saudia Arabia, it is not fair to allow women the right to work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for her, and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the social pressure to do so also. Also women cannot not keep the rule where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands, and then still expect larger inheritances. That kind of change is what (most) feminists would do if they got involved (western ones wont anyway apart from to talk about it), as they would only focus on womens issues such as right to work, yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially looked after. I am not speculating, similar things happened right from 1st wave feminism (and \[some\] feminists did this on purpose e.g. took property that they acquired the legal right to but the MEN still had the responsiblity of the tax for, and some men went to jail for not being able to afford their wifes property, which they would still keep and would not sell)"""
"Also, we cannot blame a flawed concept such as toxic masculinity or patriacrhy when a promininent feminist writer, on a newspaper with millions views per day, says that when a boy is raped by a woman it is not rape, when a girl is it is, the boy enjoyed it, if he didnt enjoy it he probably did deep down inside, and now we should not arrest women who do this, but should men: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/29/barbara-ellen-madeleine-martin-comment Sadly, that is gynocentrisicm and sexism towards men (it is sad state of affairs I have to say against men as sexism is assumed to be against women)"
I don't think it's fair to say feminists don't care about male victims. Look at the Duluth model. It's obvious that rather than simply overlooking men they're actively conspiring against them.

"4 simple Activities/Habbits to develop during quarantine in order to transform yourself.Ive seen people talk about how during these times of uncertainty it is important to love and forgive yourself, to allow yourself to eat snacks and trash foods, to spend *(waste)* your time playing video games and binge watching shitty tv shows and Netflix series. While I agree that its good to spend some time having fun and enjoying yourself, this is no excuse to let go and consume your free time. Instead, I **urge** you to **PRODUCE** instead of **CONSUME.** 1. **WORK OUT** - Im hopeful that at least 90% of the active users of this sub have already developed and follow a work-out routine. This goes to the people that are not already working out and especially for those who have been working out and have stopped due to the lockdown. Just get yourself up and do it. It doesnt matter what you do, just go for a walk, a job, run, ride your bike, do some push-ups, burpees, bodyweight squats. There is an abundance of exercises you can do anywhere, anytime. Your gym being closed is NOT an excuse to sit on your couch and get fat while you play Call of Duty or something and eating oreos or other trash foods. Work out, your body will thank you, your mind will thank you. Working out relieves stress, improves your cardiovascular health, your immune system, as well as your body and mind altogether. If youre struggling to find a routine to follow during quarantine, feel free to shoot me a PM or Ill post a free home workout program here. 2. **Start cooking** Cooking is fucking amazing. It is one of the most relaxing activities I do on a daily basis. Besides the fact that youre being creative and cooking your own meals which helps avoiding trash foods, snacks etc. It is also a perfect time to listen to an audiobook, a podcast or any other educational/self-improvement video/audio. I find myself being extremely focused when I cook and I absorb any information easily. If youre not into audiobooks/podcasts, just put your favorite tunes and vibe it out. But for real, start cooking your own meals, its great and its not as time consuming as you might think it is. 3. **Educate yourself** 3 easy suggestions: 1) **Read books.** Any book that seems interesting to you, read it. TRP is the reason I now read books and it has insane benefits for the human brain. It helps me build focus, expand my vocabulary and gain knowledge on a wide spectrum of things (psychology, philosophy, business, finance). It started with The Rational Male and turned into Friedrich fucking Nietzsche and Ancient Greek philosophy. 2) **Take online classes.** There is an abundance of free online classes available. Hell, even watch youtube videos about something and take notes. Its 2020, education is available online and for free. I feel like a moron for wasting 6 years getting 2 university degrees. 3) **Watch documentaries/docuseries instead of TV shows.** Documentaries about anything, serial killers, abuse, gender equality (if you wanna get triggered). Anything is better than watching pointless TV shows. 4. **Develop new skill(s)** On the same note as the above, try to improve yourself by developing a new skill. Two personal examples Im focusing right now are: Learning a new language and experimenting with investing/day trading. But this can be anything, a physical skill (learn how to handstand or smth), play an instrument, learn coding, cooking (see point 2.), fix things, build things, craft etc. Your future self will be glad youve taken the time to develop new skills. 5. **Meditate** Its important to train the mind as well. Take time to dose off, give your head some space. Relax and focus on your breathing and how your body feels. Remember that you are the essence living inside the body, so take care of the presence. Remind yourself of what is within and come to peace with it. It will greatly relieve your stress, anxiety, depression, as well as to improve your sleep and attitude in general. **Epilogue:** This is the perfect time to work on you. Improve you. Fix you. Transcend you. There is no excuse for being lazy, having terrible eating habbits and not taking care of yourself. Remember that one day things will go back to normal. You can be the guy who comes out of this completely transformed. Healthier, better looking, wiser, craftier and maybe even wealthier. Do you want to waste your life because there is a global pandemic? Do you wanna come out of this as a loser with no money, like a junkie who will seek cheap dopamine rushes and quick moments of fun? Or do you wanna come out like a stoic roman emperor, ready to take on the world again, fuck his way to the top, ready to make money, lift heavy weights and live life to the fullest? **MEMENTO MORI** - *You could leave life right now*. Choose wisely. **Edit:** Thanks for the feedback. To those who described the post as ""basic"", I know, this is not a groundbreaking research paper. But please remember, not everyone has their shit together. Not everyone has a strong purpose and discipline. We all start somewhere. 3 years ago I would find this post complete bullshit.

"You need to do some more research on your evo-bio/evo-psyc. Unlike most mammals human women have concealed estrus. That's because back in the day men and women weren't polygamous and free like you think. The women were using sex with alphas to procreate (during that hidden ovulation) and trading sex with betas in exchange for resources, favors, assistance with her existing children, etc during the times in her cycle she was unlikely to get pregnant. Pre-ag revolution most females procreated yet the majority of men did not. &nbsp; ""Betas"" have **never** been the prize for women. They've **always** been who they settle for after they've had their fun with the alphas and couldn't lock one down, or who they've used to extract resources in exchange for trickle sex. &nbsp; And for the record I hate using the Alpha/Beta terms as bucket words, but for the autists in here it's just simpler that way."

"The impact of a man's past on him is very different from the impact of a woman's past on her - and the difference can be day and night when the man has the tools to deal with his past.**TL : DR - What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger, once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman damages and enslaves her for life, with recovery a rare exception.** **We're specifically talking about past experiences here.** As tomes of RP posts and reports coming from direct experience would have told you by know, a woman's past does matter a lot. Even a guy like Roosh who had sex with hundreds of women when he retired admitted he'd only want women with zero or low n counts. A man who is sexually very successful is seen as extra attractive despite his reputation while a woman who is too loose is slut shamed or considered washed up especially after she's spent her prime years riding the CC. On Tinder it couldn't be more blatant that 80-90% of the women want to fuck the top 10% of men. A man who fails sexually is an object of ridicule by both women and other men while a woman who saves her body for the best man / men is appreciated for her taste. Instinctively our standards for men and women are opposites. While a feminine dominant society tries to shame men for taking her past into consideration, and shames men for the expectation of wanting either virgins or women with a low n count, while simultaneously encouraging her to be ""sexually liberated"", make ""her choice"" and on top of that later down the road, tries to convince a man that she has ""matured"" or is ""over it"" or ""now knows what she wants"" (lol the irony), we observe the actual scenario and know far better what's really up. Of course, there is always a set of women especially in more conservative countries who are 1-2 generations behind the current state of the West to try to play the ""I want a virgin too or a good man with a low n count card"" in the name of ""equal logic and equal standards"". Whatever the strategy used by different societies, discussions of one's past bring up fierce debates on unfairness and equality. However life doesn't run on machine logic. A man's past is a problem for him when it injures him deeply - either physically, or emotionally or mentally, and when he has neither the tools nor the awareness nor the frame to deal with it. If he doesn't find the tools, the results can be catastrophic. One only needs to look at what kind of shit men can land up into - violent crime, abusive relationships, suicides, drugs, alcohol -- and every one of this is due to past trauma that never found space and consciousness to heal. To add to the challenge, men often do not have support systems, those whom he needs in his low moments ditch him for the good times and he is ridiculed for trying to seek help. Man is ridiculed for even saying he has a problem. Even in effective support systems meant to help him, he has to face at least 50 people all calling him a faggot for every mistake and has to earn his respect (MRP, I'm looking at you...and respect you). A man learns soon that there is no substitute for strength and being proactive. Let's make the exception for lasting physical trauma. Soldiers who come back with PTSD and worse from wars have often been found to have suffered lasting brain injuries and lesions, which are responsible for the symptoms. Some people with an altered personality have been known to have had a brain tumor in a particular part of their brain. So, physical damage is the one thing a man might totally not recover from. But that hasn't stopped them from trying. But when a man does have the tools and cultivates some awareness and frame, the mental and emotional scars can soon be overcome, and except severe injuries that caused permanent damage to the body, many injuries and diseases can also be fixed medically today. Everyone who has ever contributed to RP awareness has shared their own tools from their toolbox for this purpose (for those who ask). I too found some really powerful tools for me, which I have shared. Once a man has somehow found the space he needs to make even a little peace with his past, his problem solving mind gets to work, learning lessons from the experience, developing a new mindset and approach, looking at what went wrong and how to improve his results. Recognizing that there is no support granted to him, but the need must still be addressed nevertheless, a man decides to create what is missing in life himself, walking the hard path. It is a long an arduous road to create what has not existed before. If needed, man seeks out discomfort in planned doses, gains additional experiences, works on himself and gets better and better every time with each additional experience, every failure and success until he masters the challenges that once seemed impossible to him. As every rep he does stimulates more muscle to grow afterward, men simply improve with experience. Men use their past to attain mastery in the present. Man essentially runs on the paradigm **""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger""**. Of course let's be practical and add this line - **""Once he recovers from it. ""** This is also and especially true for sex. A man who has embraced his sexuality gets better at the game with every experience. A man once awakened, doesn't mind systematically annihilating his past dysfunctional self to become a more evolved being. A bad past however has a much worse impact on a woman, given her much greater sensitivity. It creates a self perpetuating trauma pattern in her that keeps her locked in it. If her past was abusive, expect her to have a much greater tendency to pair up with the abusive assholes and suffer all her life, even if it means her children suffer at times. 10 minutes of sex god and she is alpha widowed for life and can't enjoy sex that way with other men again. 10 years of riding the cock carousel before settling down with a nice provider means it's only a matter of time before she gets bored with marriage and aspires for the thrill of the chase again -- once unstable relationships, always unstable relationships. Or if she gets violated against her will, she can feel horrible, ashamed, dirty, even defiled and this can make it impossible for her to let go and enjoy herself with a future lover. There is no end to those complications and all the forms past unresolved emotions can take. **In matters involving any significant intensity of emotion, a woman essentially becomes the victim of her past pleasure and pain.** Bitter experiences can force women to wear the pants, man up and step up to the challenges, especially if her mama mode is activated. But these usually leave her still scarred bitterly at the emotional level. A woman who has to wear the pants in the house invariably develops contempt for the man who doesn't. Behind every feminist champion, you can always find a woman emotionally scarred to some degree or the other. Tough women especially carry boat loads of unresolved emotional pain. There are many such women who have manned up only to lose faith in men and carry bitterness and contempt towards men for not having the manliness that a woman was capable of summoning. Unresolved past sexual trauma can subconsciously force a woman to make herself unattractive and unhealthy, which is what we see in many feminists, as a way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of that experience and getting hurt again. By comparison, men who are hurt try to avoid relationships. The tendency of the feminine ego to seek refuge in the feeling of victim hood does not help in this - it helps keep her past alive in her. A bad past just gives the victim tendency a first class ticket. The fact that women tend to be a herd animal with a significant collective hive mind component to their existence makes it worse. In one room, all that one woman has to do is to bring out her past emotions and you can be sure that within minutes, even seconds, that all the women are feeling the same thing. The impact of past experiences on a woman is simply deeper and bigger already due to their sensitive nature, and it only gets multiplied further by the collective pain body of the feminine. We even see this any time she's in a bad mood -- they remember past miseries and mistakes in excruciating detail don't they? Not all of a woman's pain or emotion is hers alone, it's the pain and emotion of womankind. Let's not even get started on bad habits. Women who get into drinking and drug abuse wreck their lives and the lives of their families and children in spectacularly horrible ways. And once it starts it becomes near impossible for them to stop. I see a lot of men in mrp in the OYS threads working on their addictions from alcohol to the smartphone and porn, but I don't get to see many woman come out of deep shit by themselves. They'll need help, if they are capable of being helped at that point that is. While a man can get to enjoy the feeling of mastery at the end of his struggles and suffering and victory, a woman is still left with a bitter taste in her psyche and lots of unresolved pain even if she ends up succeeding. Even success doesn't seem to fill up a woman's emotional holes - you can see this with any successful woman who had to wear the pants to get there. There is some unhappiness in their tone, as though they regret the impact it had on their femininity. As for a history of crazy sexual behaviour, when I see the stories of many of these women, with notch counts that would have been impossible without contraception, their troubling past prior to that, along all the thoughts and emotions that these women admit to having over time swinging across the entire spectrum, and add the impact of powerful sexual memory on their system, all I can say is that it's a case of absolutely fucked up, both inside and out. The fuck up outside just reflects the fuck up on the inside, and makes it worse. The biggest mistake is to assume and believe what they say as if the impact of such powerful emotions and experiences can simply be wished away by rationalization. A lifetime spent running full throttle in one direction will never magically fix itself overnight. As I wrote in my post on the irony of ""Choice"", it is stupid to think you are choosing when your mind has this much grip over you. These women may claim they are over it, but deep down their minds are still in the same deep turmoil of thoughts and emotions as ever and they have never addressed that. That software runs freely on the inside, just hidden. That won't stay quiet for long. Sooner or later their unhappy selves are going to emerge for the next round of seeking salvation elsewhere, or they are going to go crazy. And that's why you should never listen to their claims that they've overcome their past. That as you will read below, requires exceptional work, the honesty to face oneself and take responsibility for once, and they should have clearly done it and have results to show for it. You cannot practice instability all your life and then hope to stay stable and committed one fine day. How in the world did men start believing that shit and even white knighting for it by any logic is beyond me. So for all but the most spiritual of women, a woman essentially runs on the paradigm of being a victim of her past -- **""What doesn't kill her enslaves her"". Recovery? Oh God...** Why I said all but the most spiritual women was that there are some women who do find tools to work on themselves, a few do end up recovering from their past experiences, but if you've ever read some of the books written by them on the subject, you can tell that the recovery process is a battle, involving massive emotional releases, moments of very altered moods and the like - it's like 4th of July. The key difficulty is that women being more emotional, find the way of awareness and inner peace inherently more difficult, and have a lot of extra pain to resolve. Usually devotion, service, nurturing others and emotional methods work much easier with them (which is why more women than men go seek religion). But it is not impossible, and the tools can also work extremely well with them. In fact most of the tools will work on anyone who is serious about using them. Trouble is, many of these women are too deep into the grip of their own past patterns to get to the start line even. It takes women years of work to get to a point where a lot of their traumatic patterns are dissolved and we're back on a clean slate, though by then, they might not even be physically in their prime. Biologically women have a shorter prime than men to bear healthy children and then be healthy enough to raise them to adulthood. Men on the other hand, can keep their physical and reproductive prime up for longer. The task of ""annihilating their past unhappy self"" is therefore much harder for a woman and needs more work. A man would find it easier to help himself or recruit help where he doesn't find help by default, but women really do need far more hand holding when dealing with deep inner pain. Sometimes absolute dominance is probably the only way to force them to start to work on themselves. Biologically a woman who has a bad past or a history of bad habits, or even a very stressed history has a much greater chance of hurting the physical and mental health of an unborn child. In old school societies, lots of care is taken to see to it that pregnant women are kept emotionally ""well fed"". Just a history of lots of stresses, irregular hours of food, diet and rest can damage their fertility and reproductive health. No one mentions the impact of abortions and contraception on reproductive health and hormonal balance. A woman's body is a significant biological investment, and men are biologically wired to be repelled by women with a history of destructive habits and behavior. Do keep in mind though that a man's bad habits like smoking and drinking and sedentary living also damage his reproductive health and T levels, but again, good habits, lifting and diet can go a long long way to correcting this. Fitness also has equally positive effects on a woman's health, but most unhealthy women I tell you also come with a significant degree of mental and emotional illness and are too far in a hell hole to even turn up at the gym. **Most women who are unhealthy today are actually so because of an underlying emotional or mental problem, while most men are just plain lazy**. In my world, women will have to lift, do yogic practices and meditate. For their own good. I won't accept those not willing. Amidst all this, anything a woman gains in technical skill from her sexual experiences can easily become irrelevant. Besides, a skilled man can always train a willing woman (go to mrp and see that latest post), leaving her free to concentrate on the seduction part of her game. I honestly feel sadness and pity for many of these women whom I see, broken wrecks of what could have been. I couldn't stay cold about it if it happened to any of the women in my family or life, but honestly, they're doing it to themselves and save-a-hoe is just stupid -- the foolish nice guy who wants to save them and change them just gets swept into that shit and realizes too late that this is way beyond his power to solve, and he might not even be able to get out safely from crazy. In the case of woman and the impact of her past on her psyche, prevention was always far better than cure. Let's be real about that. That's why old societies were always so strict with their women. So in the end, a man's past can end up making him stronger and wiser and he can look back at it honestly without toxic shame, with a degree of pride and gratitude even -- as a very harsh teacher, but the one he needed, that taught him permanent lessons. Women on the other hand, are often left with permanent or lasting physical and psychological damage from their pasts far more than lessons learned. Men become responsible for themselves over their past, women become victims of their past. **And that's why a man's past and a woman's past are simply not comparable.** We're not denying that men too get damaged from their past, but unless its a serious physical injury, it is indeed easier to recover from that and emerge stronger than it is for a woman. What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman tortures her for the rest of her life. And that is how it goes for all but the most exceptional cases. *PS : When I used the word ""past"", it wasn't in the context of reputation, but past experiences. Now about reputation -- A woman's reputation did matter enormously in societies of the past, and I myself know that my grandmother would have preferred death to shame and loss of reputation. But in a feminine primary society, the sisterhood will defend her in public, encourage her in private and bitch about her behind her back. Yes, that last part is true.* *A man's reputation however is everything, especially in this kind of society. It is more vulnerable than the most delicate and sensitive woman, and as easy to shatter as glass, and easier to damage forever. A woman will cast allegations on you, even and especially false ones if it benefits her, her sisters will vilify you as a monster, your rival men, her orbiters, and envious betas will rush to her aid, glad to see your downfall, the white knights and SJWs will attack you, and the justice system exists for the sole purpose of screwing you forever, you'll be abused and raped in prison hell, you're out of the job market, the feminist dominated media will write any shit on you if it sells, society treats you in ways they didn't treat slaves or untouchables, and your best hope is to actually STFU and fight to the end --* ***rape of a man is the rape of his reputation and freedom.*** *Once raped, it will never recover to the way it was formerly.* *Only God alone can save you if truth is on your side TBH. So remember Law #5 always --* ***So much depends on reputation, guard it with your life!***"

"When I read the title I thought ""past"" as in ""reputation"". Good post! I think a reputation in the other hand, hurts men more if he has a bad one. You never see a woman with ""sex offender"" on her criminal record. But a man (one of my friends actually) got charged with such, for doing NOTHING. False accusations and false witnesses who just wanted to get back at his family, ruined his life. 4 years of house arrest from 20 years old and on the sex offenders list. And if not that extreme, then not keeping yourself up to standards (being late, unreliable work etc) won't get as much slack as it would a woman. Women can blame bad rep on ""being a weaker sex"" when it's to their advantage."
"When I used the word past, I mean past experiences. Maybe I should have put the word experience in the title, but that is one thing that can't be edited later on, you only get one chance. There isn't a single post of mine where I ever felt I truly nailed the title, but I think the readers will get what it means. I'll put that word in the TL:DR and a note at the end. Nailed it on the subject of reputation. A man's reputation is everything, but especially so in a female dominated society where women's reputations can be hamstered away with support from the sisterhood."
Man titles are so hard. I've been working on a book for a while and I still have no idea what I'm gonna call it.
notify me when you publish it :)
There are a lot of good insights in this post that square with what I have observed in my life. I suggest younger men on this sub save it and re-read it periodically.
"Good past, nice comparison. Made for interesting reading. I've seen similar things in men and women in my life, but never drew them together in a narrative as you did. Nice! Cheers"
This is so accurate. Im so thankful for finding this sub.
"Incredible post, thank you."
If a girl went cold suddenly after constantly texting and gets back after 2 days. Does it come across as butthurt or immature to take the same amount of time to respond?I actually got needy at some stage and send a needy text and later I recovered by posting stories on Instagram and I think she got back sensing that I was not needy after 2 going cold for 2 days.
"Text her if you want to text her, dont text her if you dont want to text her. It doesnt really matter what she thinks because as long as you are trying to please her mojo you will never have it right."
"I wouldn't wait 2 days. She's already showing disinterest and can take or leave you at this point. Secondly, depending on how savy she is, she might see right through that. But obviously, I wouldn't rush to return to text her either."
"I feel evil for living the TRP philosophyHey guys, So Ive been off of the TRP subs for close to a year now, as I spent most of 2018 reading, absorbing, and learning as much as possible. The last year was spent applying what Ive learned. No shocker here, but the results have been great. Success with women has been awesome, Ive built my own business, improved my physique and also replenished my finances. Lately though Ive been feeling some anxiety and low level depression seep back in, so Ive restarted my therapy appointments. With the TRP principles internalized, its hard for me to not speak about certain subjects and it comes out through a TRP perspective. I can already tell that my (female) therapist thinks Im sexist or misogynistc. Pretty much any of the females in my life come to a similar conclusion and think Im an asshole, or evil. Im not an autist with what Ive learned. I dont openly talk about TRP concepts or shove it in anyones face. But Ive internalized enough of it now to the point of its just who I am for the most part. I dont try to manipulate anyone, make them feel like shit, or harm anyone. I try to be an all around good person, but yet Im still hearing these comments and seeing disgusting faces at my beliefs. Really just looking for some wisdom to consider and chew on from you guys. Just to ground myself and reset. Edit - Just remembered that my therapist is also a lawyer that specializes in divorces. Things are starting to make a bit more sense now."
"The thing I remind myself is that the root of the red pill metaphor is *TRUTH* Sometimes the truth is ugly. It can be depressing. But that doesn't make it any less true. Being raised incredibly bluepill and then realizing that women are wired to think and act in ways that are less favorable to the true love bluepill fantasy can be heartbreaking. As far as feeling guilty though? All you are doing is adjusting your actions based on those of others. It would be immoral NOT to do that. Frame your ""misogynistic"" statements as responses to the actions of women and it shuts people up."
I've never been in therapy but I imagine a female therapist is about as BP advice as it can get. Try switching to a male therapist?
"Ive had 3 therapists now (had to switch twice due to them being flakey and unable to keep appointments) and they are very BP. Its really, really hard for me on the days where I want to address an issue thats about women, dating, relationships, etc. because I know its not going to do much good. I try to finely craft my words to make them not as harsh while still getting my perspective across, but Im always given BP suggestions. My perspective always ends up being looked at as the issue, and they try to find ways to help me adopt a more BP outlook."
"Its called the Redpill for a reason. The truths contradict a lot of what is societally acceptable(even though society loves rewarding us with things like job success and women). Watch the matrix, taking the redpill means discarding reality as we know it, so of course people are going to assume you to be evil."
"Thats what Im trying to remind myself right now. Normally it wouldnt bother me because I know the TRP principles are rooted in truth, but I guess Ive just been seeing the disgusted, youre evil reactions a lot in a short amount of time recently and its getting to me. Ive applied the TRP principles with incredible success so far, and today in particular I was sharing how I dont wish to be legally married or really ever cohabitate with a woman. Shes said that this perspective was rooted in fear. Aka: this perspective is a problem and we need to address it. Its not fear, its just applying what Ive learned and making logical decisions. There is zero benefit for me to do either of these things, yet those under the BP veil will shame you for not going through with them."
"Thanks man. I appreciate it. Today in particular was a lot of discussion about my LTR. Weve been in an incredibly healthy relationship for a year and half now (because I lead the way with what Ive learned here), but shared with my therapist that Im getting a bit bored and feel trapped. I do not want to settle down, and I still have a desire to date and bang other chicks. This was seen in a negative light and it frustrated me. Why must every relationship be boom or bust? So if we dont get married and do everything the traditional way, were wasting time? I dont believe that at all."
"Dont Be A Sucker - Go Straight To The Source There are more and more business, dating, lifestyle, and personal transformation gurus than ever before. Selling courses, counseling, and coaching at a heavy price. Most of these experts never sell anything original - it is just watered down concepts and advice sold in a new shiny wrapping. I have acquaintances that have bought into pick-up bootcamps, paying 1000 dollars for a weekend - none of them get any better results than the ones that learned through free content and forums on the internet. Some of them are still struggling on the same level they were a couple of years ago. I have a close friend that paid the same amount of money for a meditation course. Where he was given a special mantra. He later told me that he found the instructions and his personal mantra on the internet for free. I paid 12 dollars for Roy Masters meditation audiobook Be Still And Know which you can find for free on YouTube. Realize your favorite self-development guru has learned from someone else above them - the real experts. You can learn from these originators at a fraction of the price your favorite guru wants you to pay. These self-proclaimed mentors often follow the same format. Many will have a YouTube account in order to generate, leads, traffic, and build up trust with their audience. This is done by giving away free value and content in order to establish their brand. Another side effect of giving away free content is that it leaves the potential client with thoughts such as - Well if all this great content is free, imagine what the paid product will do for my life The truth is that the product being sold to you will likely contain the same information that you can buy as a book on Amazon for a few dollars instead of hundreds and thousands through an online course. The YouTube videos will contain a link to a landing page for the product steeped in marketing techniques such as scarcity marketing, big colorful buttons, and graphics. It will contain powerful statements such as: * Live An Incredible Life...NOW * Feel Unstoppable In Your Personal and Business Life * Unleash your Authentic Self You get the message - whats funny is once you have seen one landing page you have seen them all. Another strategy you will come across is the discrediting of the original source and author. Sure all these books and authors are great, but they dont teach you how to take practical steps - which I do Even well-established success gurus such as Tony Robbins have had personal models. He learned about motivational speaking from Jim Rohn. He learned Neuro-Linguistic-Programming. A powerful system to change habits, emotions, and thoughts, from the co-founder John Grinder. He re-packaged NLP and incorporated it into his books and seminars. A Tony Robbins seminar called A Date With Destiny costs 2,000 dollars. Richard Bandlers NLP book Make Your Life Great costs 12 dollars. And will contain the same strategies and techniques that Tony Robbins teaches. So I hope you dont buy into the hype or let them play on your insecurities. Everything you could ever need in terms of guidance and information is out there for free."

"Imagine spending a G on a meditation course taught by some hipster from Brooklyn NY. People actually paying some soy boy to teach them to sit and breathe. Almost all these self-improvement courses are rehashings of things taught by philosophers (Plato, Buddha, etc)."
"Always thought that, i'm irritated that some of my friends are complete fanboys of this types of gurus"
"Your view is missing one key aspect, and that the psicological hook that some things can have. Is not about if the content is the same or not, some people have the ability to put that content in your head more way more effectible that you will do reading the 12$ book by your own. Some people don't need help, they just need the information and they will get things done withouth help, but some people do, and that is the people that most likely will buy the book and never read it, or read it and do nothing with it. If you put 1000 dolars in something, there is a very good chance that you will invest the time and effort to make that money worth. I'm not saying that paying 1000 dolars to some stupid youtube influencer is the way to go, but for some people it will help (assuming that the dude is not bs and is actually selling something good), after all, 1000 dolars for changing your life is still very cheap. We spend far more money in things that we don't need and that won't really make our lifes better. There is more than one path to success, while the fundamentals are always the same, different people will need/take different paths. Dont try to box everything in such a simplistic way of thinking."
For all those who don't want to walk the hard road.
"Buddy of mine lost like 100lbs and paid some pick up artist coach dude or whatever a few thousand dollars. They went out a few times but he still got most of his plates off tinder. I guess it was good for him because it got him out of his shell, made him way more social. He was going out to clubs, getting bottle service, all that shit. This was the guy who was too fat and socially anxious to chill at a house with 4 people in it a few years ago. Of course I ripped on him about paying a pickup artist coach but hey, he can wipe his ass with 5 grand and not even blink. Dude makes 5-6x what I do. Perspective is everything. Could he have learned all that online? Sure. Would he have gone out on his own? Probably not."
"I think that's the only reason for paying for things like that - it forces you to learn it and do it, because people value the things they pay for. You could theoretically skip college and read the Great Books, and take online courses for free. Do most people do that? No. They need someone else to feed it to them. Otherwise the laptop or the books will just sit there in a shelf. Most people won't read or study, if there isn't a test next week."
"My parents spent $1000 on TM meditation (transcendental meditation) 17 years ago. This thing saved my life. Sometimes it's not how much you spend on something, but the value you get out of it. Sure I could have googled the special mantra I received, but 17 years later, I'm still leveraging TM to go through my divorce, my wife's false allegations of rape against me, and her denying access."
May you reach the day early when you realize the best source of knowledge are your fuckups and your self-observation skills in life
"""Women academics submitting fewer papers to journals during coronavirus: Men are submitting up to 50 percent more than they usually would """
"Can't say I'm too surprised as it seems the same sort of phenomena seem in the past with academics on parental leave following the birth of a child, but also not sure about what to do with this. Any thoughts? As with many things, I'd expect a lot of proposed plans to be likely to fail to address the full range of incentives they might otherwise create. e.g. if men are assumed not to be spending time while on leave or in quarantine doing the work of parents but rather doing research, any policy intended to address this issue would seem likely to strengthen incentives for men not to parent. As the moment there's also a narrative of women's research contributions tending to be ignored, whereas in this case it seems to more openly acknowledge that the research simply isn't getting done due to competing time commitments for things like parenting. I have a feeling that that will soon be forgotten again. One trend that I'm also wondering about is household cleanliness and how quarantine might impact that. Are people actually keeping their homes significantly more clean than in the past due to concerns over the pandemic, or might some levels of cleanliness be relaxed due to not having to worry about entertaining guests during this time? (Am thinking here of women doing disproportionate housework, but perhaps also due in part to arguments that I've heard that women are held to higher standards for this - but perhaps from visitors rather than from their partners)."
"> Can't say I'm too surprised as it seems the same sort of phenomena seem in the past with academics on parental leave following the birth of a child, but also not sure about what to do with this. Any thoughts? Clearly there should be enforced gender-quotas for home-workers - only thing we can do really! /s just in case"
"Who ***cares***? No seriously, why in the world do so many people care about policing the choices women make? Perhaps female academics are ***choosing to make other things a priority*** during this time. Maybe at the same time more male academics are throwing themselves into their work to stave off boredom during isolation? It's one thing to wonder what the causes of this disparity are, but this language of ""oh heavens! There are fewer females doing this completely voluntary thing! WE MUST HAVE COMPLETE PARITY EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES!"" is just so tiring. It's never going to happen, folks. Men and women are just different. YES, on average, YES there is a large overlap, but you knew that already. We ALL know this. We do! People just like to pretend otherwise so they can get upset about something and whine about how oppressed they are. It's dead tired and I can't bring myself to give a shit. Oh no, not enough vaginas or feminine penises writing academic papers? Write them your own damn self if you care so much."
">This evidence is anecdotal: Some journals say theyve seen no change, or are receiving comparatively more submissions from women since self-quarantine began. Would be interesting to see a more rigorous examination of this phenomenon, mainly to confirm that it's actually real."
"I dont understand what they did with the child before covid and how they had the time to write? The children discussed in the article were relatively young (4,7,9) so its not like they were in school all day then could take care of themselves. At somepoint, before Covid, these women were spending time raising their children. Or they werent and just putting them in child care for the 12-14 hours a day they needed to work on their papers. In which case I ask what the real priority (or problem) is here?"
Having kids with you 24/7 vs having them with you maybe 10 hours a day makes a big difference I'd think.
"Who is more likely to have children, female academics or male academics?"
"To quote [a 2013 article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/07/for-female-scientists-theres-no-good-time-to-have-children/278165/): > The married mothers of young children--that is, children too young to attend school--are 35 percent less likely to get tenure-track jobs compared with married fathers of young children. The same women are 33 percent less likely to get jobs compared with unmarried women who aren't the parents of young children. However, unmarried childless women are four percent more likely to get tenure-track jobs than are unmarried childless men. At this professional turning point, family formation probably explains why female scientists don't get tenure-track jobs."
"> a 2013 article in The Atlantic: Anything more recent? Society is changing rapidly these days - I'd question anything more than 5 years old, and would aim for articles with a max-age of 2 years or less, given how quickly society is changing. 10 years ago, 3rd wave feminism wasn't even in the mainstream. Now we have 3rd wave, antivax, facebook, cambridge analytica, fake news, and a clown in office."
"How important IS vetting?Hey ladies, I just have a general question about vetting, and the importance of it. I have been reading and re-reading the Surrendered Wife in the past year and a half, as well as listening to Laura Doyle's podcasts. I just get confused because there's so much in her theories that makes it seem like nearly every marriage situation IS salvageable. She even came out to say that she now doesn't agree with the statements in her first book about not surrendering to men in specific situations, like for example addictions. I've read columns where she interviews women who have never even really respected their husbands from the beginning, and they most certainly didn't vet, BUT they applied the skills and they have transformed their marriages. It seems to me that here in this sub there's a lot of emphasis on proper vetting, and that if you don't do that you can't find a real captain and therefore you really can't or shouldn't submit. So, I'm just wondering if there's gray area with that? Doyle seems nearly totally convinced that any situation can be turned around. What do you all think?"
"Even if it is true that any situation can be turned around, you can still make your life a lot easier by choosing a husband that is compatible with you, and that has the same needs, wishes and goals. I had a good long think about my relationship and my husband after he proposed. I had already said yes based on emotion, but wanted to really rationally think every aspect through. The fact that we have the same outlook on many things and can truly operate as a team has made our journey into marriage and especially parenthood much easier, compared to friends who were very much in love but not necessarily on the same page about a lot of things. I guess what I am saying is that everyone can climb the hill towards a good relationship, but vetting can make you start half way up instead of at the bottom."
Okay this is awesome thank you for a great reply!
"I married young, and I often reflect on how LUCKY I was/am to have married the man I did. We have our difficulties, everyone does. But on the fundamentals, we agree, and that's so, so helpful to our marriage as a whole. Knowing that we have the same views on marriage as an institution, on money and lifestyle, on religion, and on children makes everything easier - we are never arguing about those core elements."
"I'm not too familiar Laura Doyle, but as a ""thought leader"" in this space, she'd have to say her techniques generally work, wouldn't she? It's her brand and livelihood. It would be ackward to give examples of women for whom her advice didn't work! All self help experts should be taken with a grain (bag?) of salt. In any case, the previous commenter makes a good case for vetting. I think Athol Kay (former RP blogger for men) wrote that a man's goal when picking a wife should be having the happiest family life possible, not marrying into problems and trying to rescue a woman. I'd say this applies to women as well. Obviously, vetting isn't perfect...people change, you may not really know what a person is really like until a crisis hits post-marriage (job loss, serious illness, pandemic, heh). But marrying without vetting is potentially setting yourself up for trouble and a lot of painful work... especially if you have kids!"
"Thank you for your reply. I can tend to be a little all or nothing in my thoughts processes (which is something I'm working on) so I think I can be a bit naive even and just take what a self-help expert is saying and believe it as fact, thus my confusion. So, thank you! What you say makes sense."
"There is grey area...if you just think about regular life in all situations without the red pill perspective, you will find a huge theme of personal growth in common human experiences. If you think about friendships, employment, or relationships, there are always compromises and things you put up with sometimes this is real, and positive, and helps you maintain a long relationship when times are hard. Sometimes its toxic manipulation. But when something occurs that is so offensive to you that you realize youve been lying to yourself to maintain the peace. Then you snap, and its very painful. Plenty of divorces initiated from either party come from the straw that broke the camels back. As I said, this could be friendships, or even something like a sibilings relationship. You forgive, you accept, you think about the bigger picture, and then you snap (if the relationship is toxic) It could be a job, so you rationalize that the pay is low, but its close, or they are lenient about you sick parent being frequently hospitalized, but your coworkers get offered more opportunities. Some of these things seem fair so you just reassure yourself with the positives, until one day you realized you wasted 5 years of your career, or opportunities to be more present with your children, with nothing to show for it. Relationships with men are the same. Yes, you should do the things that Laura Doyle speaks of with a man who DESERVES it. Thats the point of vetting. And seriously, ignoring addiction issues? Women who were stuck in loveless marriages with losers, mean spirited, addicted, cheating partners is what caused the feminist wave of the 60s and 70s. You can try and try and try to be a doormat, or pray, or forgive, but thats not a good relationship. Its not healthy for you. Its just convenient for him. The purpose of vetting is to find a man that will make your love easy, make your love flow naturally, and spontaneously, a life where conflict makes you feel protected and trustful, not fully responsible for just letting things slide under the rug. Find a man who is responsible, responsible for his own life, and respectful of the emotional support you will provide. Being feminine is not about being repressed. So pick a good one."
This is excellent thank you!
"There are lots of grey areas that it's hard to vet for, and that LD's approach (and other elements in the RPW toolbox) can help with. &#x200B; There are lots of elements that it can't. No amount of perfect RPW behaviour can change a man who is fundamentally opposed to you in religion, or who does not enjoy sex with women, or who does not want children, or who doesn't consider women trustworthy, or who doesn't care about fidelity, or who thinks violence is an appropriate response to poor behaviour, or who has terrible attitudes towards money. &#x200B; All of these things can ruin a marriage. Vetting is to help you avoid these dealbreakers, so that you have a fundamentally stable platform on which to build a marriage. &#x200B; As someone said below: LD has an agenda. Most people do. She wants to prove that her method works, no matter what. I think it usually improves things! But that doesn't mean you shouldn't go into marriage with a very strong idea of who your partner is, fundamentally."
"How to actually enjoy self-quarantine# [How to actually enjoy self-quarantine](https://yourroadtogreatness.com/2020/04/26/how-to-actually-enjoy-self-quarantine/) (Open the entire blog post for a better read) In the last weeks, you have probably stumbled upon some articles titled something like SELF-QUARANTINE : YOUR SURVIVAL GUIDE or HOW TO SURVIVE SELF-QUARANTINE and articles like these just elicit fear and anxiety among its readers. So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine. First and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure. This is the power of impermanence. I know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end. Allow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time. Time is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity. I am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them. The idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward. Lets get right to it... &#x200B; #### Be kind Take 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus. Check in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy. &#x200B; #### Stay healthy (Physically) This is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy! Dont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight. This is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it. Its also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm. &#x200B; #### Stay healthy (Mentally) You can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better. You can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile you know the one Weve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit. Another habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management. And yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls. &#x200B; #### Stay fit No gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways. Try a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally. &#x200B; #### Read and study One of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study. &#x200B; #### Stay connected Remember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family. Its important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have. &#x200B; #### Start your passion project Not everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion. Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started. You dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon. &#x200B; #### Learn a new skill The business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German! There are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition."
"Thanks for posting this, a good reminder/motivator to make the most of quarantine!"
I don't think any Reditors have any fear or anxiety about quarentine. Most of them have been self-isolating their entire lives.
"What are the flaws in my current mindset or do I finally get itQuit all drugs because the pill is hard and i shouldn't be seeking to suppress the harshness of reality. Quit porn because of pied and it destroys motivation. I have a job that pays minimum wage and i'm going to school at night for coding. Making more money will help raise my smv because i can buy nicer clothes and get an apartment in the city. I cut off all of my pot head friends but they're still invited to lift with me I lift 5 days a week, even when I don't feel like it. Some days your just not gonna feel motivated keep pushing and stick to your schedule. 80% i'm an aloof jerk to girls 20% of the time i buy them flowers and tell them their pretty You can only rely on your self and you are responsible for all of your actions. The past is over, you can only focus on the present and by doing this you build a better future Do I finally get it, what things am I missing? Edit: Lastly be the best version of yourself don't compare yourself to others"
I think you're doing just fine. Work on yourself. Youre on the right path.
Looks like youre making positive changes! Keep it up!!!
20% of the time you buy them flowers? I hope thats a joke
pretty sure that's an exaggeration of the 80/20 alpha/beta ratio
Or a misunderstanding of it...
Keep up with the good work. Change doesnt come overnight so dont be too hard on yourself
"If theres a flaw in your mindset, I cant see it. Youre taking responsibility for your life, cutting off dead weight, looking to better your position in life, and you understand the 80/20 dynamic. Good shit."
Right on my guy. You probably already know this but I reminding myself that there is always room for growth and improvement helps me to not stagnate
"Only tell them they're pretty when they're naked, otherwise they are cute"
"Why is the ""Women only like jerks"" thing prevalent or at the very least not applied back?So I've been thinking about this for a bit. Incels and some better men down on their luck, or guys who dont know better make the comment of ""Girls only like jerks"". Now I've thought about this and probably at one point agreed with it without thinking too much. It's a thing in popular media and sometimes guys who seem like pricks have girlfriends and every wife beater has to have gotten a wife at some point (or else it's just assault). Doesnt help that I watched a video by (Screamo? Streamo? Some variation of that I think it had an exclamation point, he interviewed the republican gun lobbyist who survived a school shooting) that literally had women calling him a jerk and a fuck boy but still saying they'd fuck him (I pulled one bit of salvageable advice out of that but that's another question) But I've realized a few things (please poke holes if you can) A) that implies monolithism (which not being that makes it really hard to discuss issues). I've met some girls who would absolutely not tolerate dickishness B) Could be other features. Most dicks are to some degree at least confident or driven so those are good qualities C) most guys that say this aren't really guys I'd like to hang out with or classify as nice But perhaps more importantly, D) guys do it too. There is this thing that I think is just as prevalent in media about a dude defrosting an ice queen for lack of a better word (is that term sexist? I think it is but languages fails me as I cannot think of a suitable replacement for the platonic ideal). The women would undoubtedly be a jerk (why does that sound masculine?), or at the very least cold and unemotional. Through out the movie (using a fictional example here) the hero would defrost her via kindness, witticism or heroism. And they'd get together. Now she doesn't necessarily have to be mean but definitely more business and aloof. Or turning it In real life I think its definitely a fantasy of most men for the same reasons above. I know I personally have had crushes on girls who were not the kindest in their interactions with people (or at the very least attraction whether they were just genuinely attractive and my brain ignored the other parts or there ""badness"" made them more attractive). Point is that it's a phenomena and something I have personally experienced so I guess ""Guys like bad girls?"". Not monolithic but it is to my knowledge a thing? So why is it not generally levied in reverse? Am I way off on my assumption and this is more a me thing? Is it patriarchy? Doe femcels not use this language? Does if have to do with framing like the most attractive women is the evil one or they are made more attractive through framing? Please correct me if I'm wrong."
"What I believe to be going on here is you have noticed how the media grabs the attention of people, largely young and immature that dont have developed emotions, portray romantic situations. When we are young and the person we like has a boyfriend or girlfriend, we often think of the other as a bad person so we arent guilty for wanting someone that is committed/involved/seeing to someone else, especially when we arent getting any attention. When media targets this audience, they portray this situation to be true, affirming the viewers feeling of their interests partner as a dick. We love feeling right. While this is largely portrayed as a young man having interest in a girl whos ex or partner is a dick (Scott pilgrim vs the world for example), it is portrayed both ways. Often, the love interest male is dating a pretty girl that isnt right for him (Im looking at you Taylor swift in you belong with me). Essentially, it is hoping that the audience watches this to affirm their feelings, so they consume the rest of the medium (movie, album, etc). It reflects a me not we mentality when it comes to love. The subject in both gendered roles is only thinking about what they want, disregarding the other person of interests choice in their actual partner. I studied what love actually is using a lot of philosophical backing, and I can say with confidence this is more possession than it is love, which is what we feel in our high school days and thats fine. Many young people confuse the two, as long as our life experience enable us to move on and exist with self love and eventual outward love. In short, its a product of immaturity more than sexism, but sexism can definitely spin this situation into something else when it comes to relationships. All that being said, people dont always choose people that are good for them. No one is perfect theres a very interesting psychological theory that analyses the people we find appealing romantically, and how it relates to our past. People are likely to date those that give us familiar types of suffering as opposed to those that show us new types. For example, if your parents always yelled at you and You never got over it, you would date someone that yelled to communicate adversity. Same thing with passive aggression, violence, and communication. We choose the familiar, unless we actively take steps to avoid it. And when someone we want to date chooses someone who gives them the suffering they are used to, it justifies the feelings I previously discussed EVEN MORE. (Heres a really cool video on the suffering bit, its far from hard science but is a really interesting theory on relationship dynamics as it relates to developmental psychology: https://youtu.be/Hvysy11716g). To summarize, love triangles are common and no one thinks wow my love interest didnt choose me, but thats fine! Until they love themselves. Edit: had to change the Taylor swift song to the one I was thinking of, and added the part about relationship dynamics"
Wow I did not the love triangle bit at all from that video but I think I got the gist of the point. Also what do you mean that's okay? As in you get over it or you dont feel bad about it?
"""We choose the familiar, unless we actively take steps to avoid it. "" I love your whole comment, it's really insightful. My love interest from last year is dating someone else and my already low self esteem decreased even more lol. Your ""loving yourself first"" to suffer less from this kind of situation is really good advice !"
"I've never really thought much about this, but I do feel like you have a point. Made me think of pretty much any big ""alpha"" male movie character or star. James Bond. Bruce Wayne. All the Pacino, Eastwood, Cruise, Hardy, Bale, Pitt, and a couple of DiCaprio and Gosling characters. Their characters are typically men of few words. Confident. Stoic. Smooth. Stylish. Guys like these can probably have any girl they want, but there is a common trope in movies that they will try to win over the girl who was initially cold to them. James Bond is actually the perfect example now that I think about it. Has less to do with the girl (or guy) itself and more to do with the ""chase"" of winning him or her over. I think another difference is that with girls there's a trope of them wanting to ""fix broken men"" that may be connected to the trope of ""girls like jerks"" but honestly idk. However, I think a key point is that most movies and media are usually not a good demonstration of how relationships work irl at all. But there's a distinction to be made. The trope isn't that guys and girls are into people that treat them like shit. The trope is that guy and girls are into people that give them the cold shoulder. Does this make someone a ""jerk""? Not really. I've definitely known guys who have straight up told me that they initially treat high-self esteem girls like shit to get them to sleep with them and it actually works. But there's a high level of confidence and nuance people need to pull shit like this off. Albeit, guys like this go through relationships like professors go through dry erase markers so this really isn't the best way to go about finding a meaningful and healthy relationship. But yeah, now that you mention it I do see how it works both ways."
"Women dont only like jerks. Some women date jerks, for multiple possible reasons - as you say, because of other good qualities they have, because the woman has low self-esteem etc. Some men date women who are jerks too. Its not applied back/talked about in the same way because we dont live in an equal world. Men have been taught they are entitled to women. Now women are finally empowered to reject men on equal terms, and many men fucking hate it. We dont currently have a big female incel culture roaming the internet. Theres probably also something in this about how a man who is a jerk doesnt have to worry about letting his jerk flag fly - whereas women are still shaking off conditioning that says they should put a mans needs first and hide their feelings to benefit his. Its easier for a man to do almost anything - including be a jerk."
Partially I think its a kink a lot of straight women have which is the result of internalised misogyny. They feel as if they have to fix men by being their emotional support so they feel drawn to these kinds of abusive men.
"Wife-beater getting their wife proofs nothing. Some might got them by being handsome or something else that doesn't correlate with jerkishness( good looks don't have positive or negative correlation with jerkishness), others might do it pretending to be much nicer people. I am a touchy person, I would never be able to get along with someone very insensitive and mean. Also it's weird how anti-feminists often complain about how complain about how touchy women are but also it turns out women also like jerks."
"I think the other version of this is men are attracted to crazy women, though its not nearly as ubiquitous as women only like jerks. Have you seen the crazy vs hot matrix? A friend showed it to me on YouTube. It seems to be widely accepted that a little crazy makes a woman more attractive and interesting, though in reality its not actual crazy so much as it is lack of boundaries or healthy lifestyle that is considered desirable, i.e. habits that are more likely to give men an opportunity to achieve their sexual goals, like a willingness to get loaded and have a threesome. However, I think that most people who believe the women only like jerks trope forget that a great many relationships start with people presenting their best selves rather than their real personality with all of its faults. So though it may seem obvious to an outsider that the men are jerks, it may not have been obvious to the women until they were already invested in the relationship."
"Also, I feel like ""crazy"" implies more fault on the side of the woman. Who ever knows someone is ""crazy"" from the first meeting? It also runs into that stereotype as women as nags, women as demanding etc., and that age-old idea of women as this inconceivable 'mystery' to men. I feel like the whole ""women only date jerks"" narrative also puts the blame all on the woman too. As in, the idea it's a matter of woman's poor judgement that jerks get dates, rather than jerks shouldn't be jerks. I don't really know if there's an equivalent for men because I feel like even the ""men date crazy women"" narrative often comes down to blaming the women over the men who are dating them, when it is often the woman still blamed by the people judging women who date ""jerks."""
Wool Vs Cotton (T-Shirt and Other Clothing Performance)
"Yeah but here's the thing. For $120 I can buy myself 13 stretch cotton-poly plain tees from Walmart, which look and feel nice. If it starts to feel or smell gross I can just change into another one, and I can do that up to 13 times in a day (unlikely but still) before I lose the benefit of buying cheaper. Plus I can just put them in the wash without thinking. My opinion is that high end tees really only have two purposes: 1. Ultra premium high thread count fabric means you're looking really fly at an event. 2. You're camping/hiking and so the properties of wool become a huge benefit. Notice how neither of those purposes include everyday use. Tees are thin, and also you wear them every day. That's a recipe for disaster that's going to end up with holes, stains, rips, etc. Which are you more comfortable trashing because of this? A $120 shirt, or a $9 shirt?"
"Fair point! I do have a few merino shirts, which I got on sale and if you take care of them (wash warm, no softeners, hang dry) they last a while. I like wearing them biking around, skiing, underneath dress shirts, travelling on a plane or long distance and other instances I will be sweating but cant change right away. I dont wear them for soccer, basketball or at the gym because theyll get too sweaty and used up. But your point stands, cotton are way cheaper and more disposable."
"But a wool shirt wont tear or smell, and you really dont have to wash it much even if it gets stains in, and when you do you probably gotta take it to dry cleaners just to maintain the quality and not damage it over long term."
"Former textiles guy here. Generally what this says about wool/cotton/poly is true but many caveats. **Poly doesnt absorb**- true the material itself doesnt absorb, but youll notice most sportswear worm when youre sweaty is poly. Why? Because you can extrude the thread in high-surface area threads break up surface tension or hollow threads that use capillary action to which away. (Imagine the play dough machine squeezing out a macaroni shape vs a star shape noodle, the star shape will wick better. Poly is also quicker to dry because it doesnt hold onto the water due to absorption. Poly is also more durable. This is because the fibers are smoother and dont create the self-abrasive friction that wears down yarns as much as other fibers. Wool & cotton are both rough under a microscope. **Cotton comparison vs wool.** - there are several types of cotton on the market. The 2 main differences in the material are 1) fineness and 2) long staple vs short staple. The construction also contributes to feel and utility greatly, but t-shirts are usually a type of knit (vs weave) The video covers Fineness a bit. In addition to contributing to hand feel it also improves color-fastness. This is because the ratio of surface area to fiber thickness is high and the dye can more fully saturate. Staple length: the cotton staple is the fiber and different varieties have different lengths. These fibers are twisted together to create a yarn (thread) and then it is knitted into your shirt. Long staple fibers can be tangled better because they can twist around each other more times. This means 1) you can get finer yarns. And 2) you have less hairs poking out of the yarn as there are less fiber ends to create the yarn. Both contribute to the smoothness of the yarn. Smoother yarn has better hand feel. This height number of tangles also means the yarn strength is better AND the smoother yarn means more durable than cheaper yarns (as with poly) Types of long staple yarn are Pima, Supima, sea island and Egyptian (high caution on Egyptian as there has been a lot of fraud there). In my opinion supima is the best, its the same species as pima but better growing methods and its guaranteed USA grown, so better oversight. Low staple cotton is generally lower quality crop with less certifications, so it is cheaper. **recommendations** If youre going to get a wool/cotton blend shit, my recommendation is merino/supima blend If you want the best 100% cotton shirt: supima cotton For a cheaper option that is more durable and has wicking and anti wrinkle properties, look for cotton/poly blends. Ratios of 60/40 or 70/30. Again my preference would be for supima/poly blend but in general the poly will make the cotton feel softer."
You don't have to spend $120 on a wool t-shirt. There are plenty in the $50-75 range: [https://reactual.com/clothing/softest-mens-wool-shirts.html](https://reactual.com/clothing/softest-mens-wool-shirts.html)
Are there any positives to the lockdown and can they better put lives once its over
"I'm assuming the ""put"" in the title should be ""our."""
Yes it was meant to be that but auto correct on phone is very annoying
"Absolutely. Time away from the capitalist treadmill gives us a chance to approach life from different angles, to work on fitness and the projects we've been putting off. To better appreciate the relationships we have, whether romantic or close friends, and to try entirely new things and develop new skillsets as a result. The lockdown is a challenge, and we should already all agree that from adversity blooms personal growth. We should ALWAYS be thankful for trials in our lives."
Absolutely well said hope you enjoyed the video
yes
What positives do you think?
Less traffic. Working from home

"STUDY SHOWS: Teachers 'give higher marks to girls' across the world and in work favour women alsoStudy shows it starts off education, girls given better marks for identical work due to teacher gender bias: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31751672](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31751672) And then goes to work: Gender BLIND recruitment (dont know sex) FAVOURS MEN and gender KNOWN recruitments FAVOURS WOMEN 2:1 [https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)"
"This is actually quite interesting , thanks."
"I find the BBC to be quite woke so thought it was heartening to see them report on this. But ... No mention of the fact that in primary school its almost 100% female teachers and in secondary school also the vast majority of teachers are female. Could this lead to the mark discrimination? Also no mention of how it might impact education and prospects for these young boys, in fact just the opposite with this line: It also raised questions about whether this really benefited girls. So boys get discriminated against in a way that disengages them from education but is it bad for the girls? Then the final paragraph which takes away from the whole article - theres no what can we do to fix this or wider discussion of the issues that boys face, but instead a quick mention that girls dont live up their ability in STEM, even when theyre better than boys."
"The idea would maybe lead some to believe that if girls are given things easier then they don't have to work as hard which can lead to failure down the line. If boys are pushed to work harder, they'll perhaps develop a stronger work ethic."
Being too stupid for work has never been even remotely a possibility in my life. Lacking credentials on the other hand obviously holds me back from better employment.
It's not one or the other. You can have differing levels of each and that's often the case. Also it depends on the industry. IT is a great example. You can list your skills without qualifications. They still help bit I've known people with little to no qualifications in very decent jobs. A great work ethic and great qualifications is the ideal. A in lack in either has downsides. Surely you understand that if you had the qualifications but didn't work hard that too would hold you back.
"Which makes sense, though hard work is only one factor in the path to success, confidence is another major part. Girls being given constant positive reinforcement (and boys somewhat the opposite) probably helps them succeed more in their life than thinking its easier than it is. Theres a lot of evidence for young women doing much better than young men at the moment, Id suggest the above plays a part in it."
Male privilege fucking sucks.
"""In the long run, the world is going to penalise you because the labour market doesn't pay you for your school marks, it pays you for what you can do."" What fucking planet does the author live on? The vast majority of differences in pay are between occupations not within them. Employers do use education as a metric for compliance though so there is some argument that teachers doing this are providing the service that employers expect."
"As someone i. School I completely agree, I see boys fat more messing around and loud while girls often just sit there wbu le the boys get told off but I see l a lot of boys raising there hands. Definitely biased teachers because the boys are normally the naughty ones so when its a girl normally theyll think its a boy."
"Feminisist fiercely oppose gender neutral consrciptionSHould conscription be gender neutral? Should we remove the man tax in Switzerland where men pay 3 percent more tax for not serving, or the prison sentences, white feathers and shaming? &#x200B; Lets take one issues affecting men and specifcally see what feminism (organisations not just random individuals) had to say about it. I have direct statements and policies from the feminisnt organisations. See below. So Norway has forced male only conscription: 1. the ultimate form of slaverly, where men, regardless of their moral background or personality are forced to learn how to kill or face prison. 2. This is one of the biggest manifestations of gynocynetsicm in society and of course proof that the hypothesis of patriarchy is as robust as modern flat earth theory. Yes men create systems to benefit men by getting men to do all the dangerous and hard things (93% of work deaths, and here the milatry) 3. Many countries need conscription as voluntary private armies are too expensive for the nation. So it is needed. Of course the feminists know this and only want men to do it. Feminists when questioned often pay lip service, and say ""yeah we support no draft, but if there is a draft women should do it too"", as they know it wont happen.. erm until it does. Norway passes both gender conscrtiption. Lets see what feminists flip flopped when shit it did happen: Firstly one party voted against it in parliment. Many of Noways feminists organisations (NKF, IAW, WILPF) were viciously against it Here is the feminists OFFICIAL STATEMENT LOL: &#x200B; >The Norwegian Association for Womens Rights (NKF) considers female conscription as a misunderstanding of the concept of gender equality and the intentions of the Law on Equality.

Thus values and practices that have traditionally characterized mens roles, have been strengthened, while values and practices that women traditionally have taken care of, have been weakened. In the current situation, however, the challenge is to strengthen womens power and influence and promote better care practices and values such as equal status. LMAO it was aliterally feminists who shamed motherhood, and demonised women who care for children. Now you want it? So women joined the coscription... but guess what they still arent 50 percent and are favoruably treated!! LMAO"
Link to source?I wanna crosspost this but need a link.
"https://womenalliance.org/no-to-female-conscription Please edit, modify, add as appropriate, maybe correct some grammar! Also the key distinction here, is that this is not random feminists, this is the actual feminist organisations of the country where conscription was made gender neutral (its still isn't men are still doing most of it) and one party voted it down. The key difference is the odd feminists may say yeah we oppose consrciption, and if it does exists we should make it both sexes... knowing full well it wont happen and they wont campaign for it.... when it does happen .... OH SHIT, lets change our tune... also"
"I dislike conscription overall. Thankfully my country doesn't have it. But make no mistake, - I would prefer to be conscripted too if half of the population is. That would simply be unfair if not otherwise."
"Good you think that as an individual, however, the point is that feminism as a movement doesn't. It also actively stops any progress for womens rights and mens rights that doesnt suit their agenda. When pioneering feminists opened up the first battered womens shelter (I cant remmeber if in europe or US) she wanted to opens a mens one and recieved death threats and rape threats by feminisists. When feminists authors did studie about domestic violence and were shocked to find out in some categories such as one way patner violence, i.e. not reciprocal women are 70% prepatrators, they received death and rape threats. Red Pill - the feminist behind it is actively boycotted, denied funding, protested etc"
I full-heartedly agree.
So are they at least going to thank men for doing the important job of defense that women are exempt from?
"Something to think about. If we take it as a given that women are constantly in danger from men, because men are physically stronger, wouldn't it make sense to make military service mandatory only for women? After all, what better place to learn how to defend yourself with or without weapons, spatial awareness etc. than there? If men are already the main danger to women and service is mandatory, then having only men do it actively REDUCES the safety of women in society, since now men are not only physically stronger and much fitter due to having spent several months if not years working on physical fitness, they're also trained in how to control, subdue, and even kill people. This only leaves one conclusion. Mandatory service only for women, for their own safety!^^^^^^/s"
">Women make an important contribution to society by becoming pregnant, giving birth and breast-feeding. Well, there's an easy solution to that: women who bear and nurse children are exempt from conscription. Women who are medically infertile or who aren't pregnant by a certain cutoff age are conscripted. You have a duty to your country that you can fulfill in one of two ways. One of those options isn't available to many people, so you should consider yourself lucky if you do have it. I don't see how anyone could disagree with that."
"Happy Friday! What men want...Good Morning! Happy Friday to all of you! I have finished reading the Surrendered Wife (wowww blew me away) and just started Fascinating Womanhood. Im quite intrigued by this very new way of thinking for me. Honestly, prior to now I never thought much about what MEN wanted. I focused more on how WOMEN were to move ahead in the world. Clearly that isnt the recipe for a happy marriage! In your experience and life/marriage/relationships - what is it, that you have found - that MEN truly want?"
"What was most profound in this book? I havent ever heard of it, but Im compiling a list of books to purchase during quarantine."
I was never raised with these tenets so it was profound to me. The concept of being surrendered yet more powerful. It seemed counterintuitive before I picked up the novel. But after reading (esp the first half) it makes a lot of sense. It is hard to explain unless you read it - and does depend on what you are looking to improve in your marriage. But for me it was
"Yes. Its hard to explain. Let go, youll fly scenario. When you respect your man and let him be a man, youll be a true partnership. Once I Surrendered he involved me more in conversation and our entire life, it was so opposite of what I was taught. Im actually a little bitter that I had to figure this out on my own and no one ever told me, showed me how to lay down my destructive weapons. I feel sorry for my grandfather who put up with such a nagging wife."
"They say they love a relationship with an independent strong woman (aka I have my own life and my own career I focus on a lot), but everyone who I have dated, who loved that about me at the start, always went one of two ways: 1. They actually don't want an independent strong woman but rather a woman who they can control. They don't like that they aren't always the only thing I care about in this world. 2. They never would go on to the next step or never would grow up - they always wanted to stay in sort of ""completely committed bachelor mode"" as I sort of like to call it. Wanna buy a house? Nah. Wanna move in? Maybe. Do you love me? I want to marry you. Would you ever actually propose we have been together for 4 years? Idk. So I have come to believe that men really just want women that either completely submit or women who aren't all about 'furthering' themselves in life - rather just have a woman who works, comes home, and hangs out and nothing else (depending on what kinda guy they are - crazy or chill). I always seeing them saying they want the independent strong woman, but I truly believe 99% of men don't actually want this - they want the illusion, the fantasy they sell themselves of this woman."
"All the awards to this answer right here! The accuracy of #2 is making me LOL. I dated a man like that to a tee, complete with all those scenarios. I see now what a complete and utter waste of time that was!"
"There are a lot of different ""types"" of people and what they say they want vs what they want. I've noticed this with both sexes too. I am a secure man (think Christian red pill) and I fully support my wife finishing her education and both her current, as well as future proposed career, among other things including helping her learn anything she wants, getting hobbies, and having self-care time (as Laura Doyle mentions is so critical). I was not hesitant about any of the things you mention, but that is because I largely knew what I wanted and I was pursuing real love, not lust, or just friendship with benefits or something. The biblical Proverbs 31 woman is so capable she works to sell things and even buys property. But the key is - everything she does is part of her household team with her husband and under his authority. It clearly talks about how her husband can hold an esteemed position because she is truly his helper, she supports him so he can function at a higher level. Wow, I would love to have this type of support! Can men abuse their authority? Definitely. Can women be just as abusive like that or in other ways? Definitely. So again, it comes down to each person's individual heart - what they truly believe in and live out. And I agree with the comments that it is an utter shame that most of us are not taught these key concepts, both men and women. There are so many opportunities in our childhood and teen years to teach them. My children will not grow up in ignorance and they and their future spouses will greatly benefit from that."
"Ive said it before and Ill say it again...I come from a long line of nagging women, but thanks to The Surrendered Wife, I left their ranks and have created a happy marriage and a happy me. Hes happy too. This book is a lifesaver!"
Sure is! Ive just started and already feel this. I know Ill need to come back to it often. Or at least get reminders from wonderful women like you!
To be respected and to be desired.
"Rejected before 11 years what to do now Before 11 ago at faculty, I met a girl at economics class, She was a cute girl and I was a loser. I was studying mechanical engineering and she was studying architecture. We had a common taste for example metal music bla bla. I fall in love with her and after a while I told this, I was rejected. Over years I didn't forget her. I tried to stalk her but she wasnot using social media. Whatever. Before 1 or 2 years ago I found her profile in a design application and I began to follow her. I think she was not using that profile so that it took 2 years for her to see me again. Finally 11 years past from my rejection and before 3 days she sent me a message at that design app, then she sent me her whatsapp, we texted 15-20 minutes or more on whatsapp and that is all. What should I do? I think I still love her. How should I treat her? Should I become silent? Do I have to hate her or like her? l want to give more detail nowl am working in a good company for years. She told me that she graduated after 9 years she failed many time and she couldnt find a job so that she continue at post graduate...."
"I'm sorry but this is sad. If you're that hung up on a person after so much time, I think you have a lot of issues you need to work out. I don't think it's healthy to be so attached based on so little. Have you read the sidebar? Seems like you haven't, judging from how you see things."
actually I was thinking that I had a solid stand. I have 2 datings at the same time I am good at spinning plate but when she appeared I couldnt know what to do
The only advice I can give you is to actually read the sidebar. Seems like you're stuck with oneitis.
"Seems like you have a chronic oneitis issue man. My suggestion is, just meet her and fuck her, then you will realize that she is not that unique, your oneitis will go out the window and youll move on. Hope this help you man"
A bit creepy man you view her as an object. get on no fap maybe. how can u spin plates but not know u shouldnt love her
She keep watcing my whatsapp stories for 2 weeks
Just bang her

"Hi all! Has anybody got any good anti-nausea remedies for morning sickness? Ive been having all day sickness for the past few weeks and its really taken it out of me. Also, should I take diclegis? The doctor has prescribed it but Im scared to take medication during pregnancy. Anyone got any experience with it? This is my first after a long infertility battle so Im very anxious!"
Vitamin B6 with half a unisom tablet helped my nausea.
Currently at 36+1 and still taking half a Unisom and B6. It's the only thing that has helped me!
"The only things that helped me was ice cold sparkling water and small but frequent meals. Never let yourself get hungry, but don't have big meals."
"I would take the medicine. How far along are you? It's advised to trust your doctor. If you want a more natural approach, have you considered a midwife? I had a midwife with my last pregnancy and loved it!"
"there's a meme in some of the pregnancy reddits about sour patch kids being surprisingly good at helping with nausea, but im not entirely sure why. some people swear by it."
I just had my first baby about a week ago and Good golly I am exhausted. Thank goodness my husband is home helping!
Congrats!! Enjoy the newborn snuggles and remember - you can never spoil a baby! This time really is so fleeting.
Reddits Female Dating Strategy offers women advice and a strict rulebook for how to act
"FemaleDatingStrategy is so awfully misandrist and transphobic (it's run by TERFs) that it's attracted the attention of AgainstHateSubreddits: https://old.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/g3qvd2/anyone_can_be_brainwashed_but_try_telling_that_to/ But somehow the conventional media are tiptoeing around criticizing it. I wonder, did the media also have similarly positive coverage of red pill or pickup artist subreddits back in the day?"
"You're not wrong, but I wouldn't give any credence to AHS."
"I wouldn't either, but they're usually aimed at groups they claim are misogynist and whatnot. For them to actually criticise women for the crime of hating men is against their biases, so perhaps underscores how bad this subreddit is. Personally I like that /r/FemaleDatingStrategy exists - it shows without a shadow of a doubt that women are just as capable of being terrible people as men. A decent chunk of feminist ideology seems to be predicated on the claim that such women don't exist, but here they are."
"The obvious answer is because its feminist in nature which gets treated better and worse at various times. In the case of media it tends to be treated better. The issue here is this is a disagreement within the camp of feminism and as such it will not be covered nearly as much. Media sites quickly picked up on things like fatpeoplehate and theredpill. These are entities without much social standing. This one is a little harder as anyone attacking it is going to be labeled as sexist, patriarchal, misogynist etc in some variety. Media tends to want to avoid that. I see the fight playing out silently with maybe some recognition if one side wins."
That's pretty breath-taking hypocrisy.
"Compare how FDS gets treated vs. how TRP is treated. They're essentially the same thing, but genderflipped. FDS does get some criticism (as it does here), but compare how much criticism TRP gets. Its quite illuminating really."
">FDS does get some criticism (as it does here), but compare how much criticism TRP gets. Is it because TRP has 25 time the number of subscribers and has been around for 6 times as long?"
"FDS doesnt advocate for casual hookups like TRP does, nor does FDS make blanket AWALT/AMALT statements that TRP does. They're similar in that they're strict, but ones for getting sex and the other is for weeding out those using them for sex to find a ltr."

social distancing is already starting to lift where i live.
"I live in the northeast so maybe my perspective is a little warped. Still though, I think its naive to assume this isnt going to change how people interact in public for a least a year or two. Especially as new waves rise and fall."
probably. i'm in sydney though so the situation is a lot different.
"You think young people follow rules? They don't care about crabs, they don't care about HIV or HPV, they don't care about herpes. You don't think sneaking around under quarantine and social distancing won't be ""fun""? Sneaking out of the house is fun. Doing stuff on the down low is fun. Romeo and Juliet was entirely about sneaking around and fucking on the down low. It won't stop anything. Also, it's a bullshit flu anyway, and when you even have medical doctors saying that, and teens and twenty year olds are seeing that, do you see them really giving a fuck? It's the new normal, a new ""herpes"" that they know they're too smart to ever get. It'll be back to normal everywhere by June at the latest I'm guessing. People will be swiping as always, using their existing IRL social networking. The real winners will be guys with 6' 6"" dicks so they can maintain social distancing and get a blowie. Hell some adult company will probably release some medical mask with a dildo attachment on it to have ""safe sex"". Sexless males are irrelevant to anyone, just like now, and just like a year ago. No one gives a shit if guys get laid. My policy is learn to use porn. Jesus, what kind of creepy parents did guys have where they weren't exposed and raised by internet porn like a normal person?"
"Lol, only men would still fucking care about dating apps and meeting for sex during a pandemic"
Healthy young people have nothing to fear from covid 19. The fear hype needs to die.
"Lots of healthy young people live with elderly relatives. That will probably increase as colleges will likely be closed until the end of the year and the retail and entertainment industries, which employs primarily young people, nearly disintegrated in the last two months. More kids moving back home. The virus may be overhyped but the economic crisis is not."
"I rarely ever go out and even I'm itching to get out and about once this shit lifts. I think you're going to see a spike in IRL interaction after this, restrictions be damned. People are barely complying with social distancing now, during the pandemic, you think it's going to hold up once we can freely go outside again? So no, if anything, it will a temporary boost for those who prefer the traditional face to face interaction."
"How do you dress breastfeeding boobs?I'm struggling with my postpartum body. I've pretty much lost all the pregnancy weight, but the weight was never the issue. My boobs grew like two cups sizes and I *hate* them. None of my light, flowy blouses fit. None of my bras. I've got a handful of shirts I'm surviving in and like three bras that actually fit... What's worse, is most of my clothes thst do fit don't fit them right. I'm top heavy. And I can't wear any tight or supportive bras while I'm breastfeeding. And I actually breastfeed via exclusive pumping, so being able to access both to put on a pumping bra is a necessity. And my husband finally has some time to help me with my intense nine month old and all the stores I would normally go to are closed. We are students, so I don't have a ton of money to spend. Amazon is a favorite. So, all that being said, any words of wisdom or links to pumping friendly giant boob clothing? I'm finding that alot of cute, fitted dresses would fit my bust but be loose everywhere else. It's hard enough being a mom to an intense, high needs nine month old with medical issues, adding in that none of my clothes fit right and she needs to be outside everyday, it's all taking such a big toll! ETA I'm in the US!"
"That sounds super difficult! Can you sew at all? I'd suggest getting some cheap, basic shirt/wrap dresses sized to fit over your boobs, then tailor them to fit your waist. Where are you in the world, so that we can help with links?"
"I have a sewing machine but haven't been able to break into it yet. My spicy girl would never let me now haha! Hopefully one day. And I'm in the US, I'll add thank. Thank you!"
"No worries! &#x200B; I think the first thing might be making sure you have the best possible undergarments. This isn't something that I have experience with, hopefully someone else can provide support (heh) on this one. But none of your clothes are going to fit well if your boobs aren't staying where they should be. &#x200B; I wonder if it might be easier to go with separates than dresses then. What about some waist-fitted nursing tops like this one - [https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=563427022&cid=1001102&pcid=1001098&vid=1&grid=pds\_30\_75\_1#pdp-page-content](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=563427022&cid=1001102&pcid=1001098&vid=1&grid=pds_30_75_1#pdp-page-content) paired with either fitted trousers or a cute a-line skirt? That way you've got easy access but are still wearing clothes that fit all the parts of you?"
"I wear [these](https://undercovermama.com/products/uc-mama-tank) clipped onto nursing bras, then my normal shirts over them. Instead of a pumping bra, I use [this](https://www.amazon.com/LactaMed-Simplicity-Hands-Free-Bra/dp/B00JAO6TT8). So when I sit down to pump, I put on that LactaMed Hands Free Bra, then my nursing apron, pull up my over shirt and unclip the nursing bra/nursing tank combo, put on my pump and do [hands on compression](https://med.stanford.edu/newborns/professional-education/breastfeeding/maximizing-milk-production.html) while pumping to increase output. ETA- May not be much of an option at present depending on where you are, but I went to Nordstrom's for nursing bra fitting. As far as clothes in general go, I really like pinkblushmaternity.com"
"I would honestly just ride it out. Your babe will be 1 and you can start weaning before you know it. By that time, hopefully the stores are opened again."
"Im on my third ebf and have found a few things that I love... First, wrap shirts if youre looking for a shirt and pant combo. Theyre easily accessible and look nice with a top heavy figure imo. I like to wear dresses, so Ive been wearing the cami dresses from old navy and gap. The tops are adjustable so I loosen them up and slip an arm out when I need to nurse. The tops are also lined so I can get away with not wearing bras with them, even with white ones. I like the midi style cause I feel like theyre more functional while doing housework, but they have shorter ones too. As far as bras go when I want a real bra while Im going out and dont have to constantly pull my boobs out I wear a Demi bra from Victoria secret. All other times, which is most of the time, I wear a bralette. They surprisingly give me a pretty good amount of support. I also just found wireless push-up bras from aerie and Im excited to try those out. I hate feeling floppy but also hate underwire when Im breastfeeding. Cant think of anything else right now, but if I do Ill let you know. Excited to see what other people suggest too cause I feel like Im in a never ending cycle of breastfeeding lol."
Carefully!
Wrap around shirts/dresses are great. I always wore layers when breastfeeding and I loved the Medela tank tops with the bra fitted (its an actual bra not a shelf). Theyre on the pricier side though which may be an issue.
I grew 2 cup sizes and they haven't gone away since having a baby 12 yrs ago. My boobs look younger than anything else on my body lol. Get new clothes and lingerie. Go by your bust size and amazon has a ton of stretchy dresses and baby dolls for bedtime I wear around the house.

"Depressed during quarantineHey guys, Need some help from the TRP community. I have been quarantine for over 2 months, I feel like my life is not going anywhere. I am not motivate to do anything, just staying at home everyday. Looking at social media and seeing my friend being happy makes me feel more shitty. Im a VERY social person so this is quite challenging for me. I used to had such as alpha mind set, now Im texting my friends and being needy. My question is how are you guys staying happy and what are you guys doing during this time?"
"Im in the same boat brother, Im a very social person too so I understand the hardship. During this quarantine I lost an LTR, my job and my apartment on top of it. Shits hard."
Keep your head up
Im not happy. Until this bullshit is over I wont be happy. I plan to hit the ground running and get back into my routine as soon as the cocksuckers in charge stop being worse for us than he virus but until then the only thing that keeps me going is this cant last forever.
"""Looking at social media "" Stop that shit. Instead of being upset over what you feel is your lack of options about your social life, start to look for ways to improve yourself. When I started to feel bad that I couldn't hit up the gym or go to the bar with friends, I started to take up jogging and improved gym like I was in prison. Instead of being upset that I can't connect with friends, I started to read and write. Research business ideas and ways to make money. Instead of choosing to embrace depression, you should choose to accept change and opportunities."
Fill your time with hobbies or exercise.
"So much things to do, read book, exercise, watch documentary, stop socmed, money heist and all that netflix shit"
"Go to the Redpill main page and do the at home workouts. Drink water with lemon in it. Sleep 7 to 9 hours a night but not more then that. Good luck, itll be okay."
">Looking at social media and seeing my friend being happy makes me feel more shitty. As you scroll through Instagram, you will eventually realize it's the same shit but different person. Right now during quarantine, all the girls are posting selfies with butterflies around their head with a plain white background, just another copy of a copy of a copy. ***Do you not get tired of seeing the same shit over and over again?*** **People don't post in social media when they are sad. And when they do post, it's usually to receive attention, it's not like they are truly happy either.**"
"Own Your Shit Weekly - April 21, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger. Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha. Gentlemen, Own Your Shit."
"OYS #10 33, 69kg, 1m80, 17% bf, wife 35, married 4 years, together 6, 2 kids (f) 2,5 years old and 1 month old Lifts kg: Squat 100, Bench 73, Overhead 49, Row 72, Deadlift 122,5 Reading: best of TRM, Heartiste, NMMNG, WISNIFG, MMSLP, Unchained Man, HTWFAIP, TWOTSM, Pook, currently rereading NMMNG My exchange with u/HornsOfApathy last week made me realize my nice guyness bleeds through even when participating in MRP. Instead of giving straight answers to simple questions, my brain gets automatically kicked into flight mode and tries to give the ""right"" answer instead of what I really think. As a result I vomit every marginally related thought, to make sure nobody misses out on any detail of my background story, hoping something sticks. Goal: mull over every question I receive on here before replying And for the record, I do like my wife, and I haven't been putting her on a pedestal for quite some time. She's alright. Reading: Stalled on NMMNG reread. Goal: read another 30% by next week STFU: Obviously my major red area, as pointed out by the replies to my previous OYS. If it's bad in MRP it's likely even worse IRL, even though I like to think I have made a lot of progress here, at least with the wife and daughter. Still failing with my parents, probably in their frame. I treat being around them as a safe space where I can vomit my thoughts and feelings, and I feel like a faggot afterwards. Goal: Consciously STFU when seeing my parents next time. I actually saw them between writing this goal and posting this OYS. I did quite well. It's funny how when you create a void, people start justifying their actions to you."
"Some solid advice I received about reading NMMNG from u/AlohaMaui808 \- take the time you need to get value out of it. If you are stuck still being a nice guy then dont rush yourself. Read at the pace you can properly absorb it and think about the activities. I read until I get to a BF activity (taking notes if anything jumps out at me) do the activity, read other peoples answers on the NMMNG sub then see if I want to add anything. Then when I type it up I do another quick pass."

Right before I started on my journey, I figured out I needed basic, new shit. Anyways, Ive only touched on the surface, more than likely. I want to develop my own signature style, that screams grown and sexy. Plan: Re-assess my current wardrobe. Find and throw away anything with a hole in it or fading in color. Buy shirts, slacks, jeans, etc. that better align with my coming image of how I see myself. (Will be ongoing). Buy some more jewelry. Im a big fan of wrist wear, but only have a MVMT watch and a bracelet thats long overdue for replacing. DoD Snowball: Week 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily. Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat. Week 3: Hygiene, Hair, Cologne: Brushing 3x, flossing 1x, mouthwash 1x (minimum). Keeping body hair trimmed and neat. Read: TRM NMMNG Reading: MAP Cant Hurt Me 'Bigger, Leaner, Stronger, NMMNG (BF activities) Career/Work: Sticking to the plan. Studying, networking, and looking for/creating opportunities. I've broadened my thinking on this, however, and realized my goals here were quite superficial. I am looking into meaningful work that will satisfy me, and enable me to live the life I want to live. This week: *Im shortening these up, so I may leave out a lot of detail. If anything catches your eye, just reply.* So, I had a fight with wife. It was all my fault. I was frustrated about some shit she had said, and took it out on her the next day. Yes, passive aggressive and weak. Id like to focus on some takeaways from the experience: 1. My wife pointed out that she had been going to bed early, because she knew that I would justpursue sex. (This is what she did) My takeaway: Im boring and predictable. I alsoforce the sexual experience instead of letting it unfold (as mentioned in NMMNG and TWOTSM). 2. (Next day) I told her that she could leave if she didnt want to participate as a family. She left and came back multiple times that day. Hysterical each time. I told her I wanted her gone, and to go take a walk for a few hours.My takeaway/actions: I acted like a bitch by giving her an ultimatum. What I mean by this is that I should not have to coax and threaten someone into doing something I want them to doespecially when it comes to participating in my family. My wife is showing me that I am not where I \*thought\* I was with my own mentality. She did threaten divorce, and I called her on her bluff. So, I may bengaf, but I still have a ways to go with frame. 3. I have backed off. I had a covert contract with myself. Half covert contract, half pride and ownership. I was still looking for approval from mommy, and it was showing up in other areas. I reset and have reevaluated wtf I was doing and how I was going about it. I realize that, despite me getting stronger, trying to be more awesome and happy, etc. I was just, slowly, building a covert contract. I didnt have a complete meltdown and light the dynamite, but (almost)everything I was doing was for the wrong reasons despite my good intentions. Action Plan: Okay, so Im reading sidebar, Im lifting, and Im STFU. Im a whole lot better than I was when I started, but Im still a shithead faggot, eating paint. 1. I am realizing I will fail at this shit, and thats okay. Whats important is to learn and keep pushing forward. I wanted to dump my whole marriage this passed weekend, but that wouldve been the easy way out. Keep pushing. 2. Learn from these experiences. As David Deida says, What is my woman trying to teach me here? What can I learn from the feminine? How can I find my more masculine source, (who the fuck I really am) through my life experiences with my woman, career, world, etc.? 3. Lead myself first, please myself first. My needs come first. **Kids:** My middle son is a mommys boy. My fault. I have not spent enough time with him, giving him the attention and love he deserves. This (probably) explains why he sucks his thumb, insists on sleeping next to mom, and defers to her authority. Ive backed off of using my forceful way of getting him to do what I want him to do. In a lot of ways, Ive used similar tactics with my wife, on him (ultimatums, threats, etc.) well, the shit doesnt work. **Further thoughts:** >Further thoughts:I'm finding less and less 'shit' to own. ~~Maybe I'm not looking hard enough?~~ **I wasnt. This hole Im in is deeper than I thought.** Im working on my mission now and getting back into my masculine by meditating and asking myself what I truly want from life, irrespective of family and expectations held by family members. Im digging deep and trying to get to the bottom of the question of Who am I. I see my woman as a representation of the feminine. As such, I have a lot to learn from her and learn about myself as I interact with her moods. I will dance with the feminine instead of seeking to control it. Pain is Weakness leaving the body. Onward."

I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls ###Mental If I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time. The external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. ###Family Still not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. ###Financial Saving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. Bought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. ###Professional My temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. ###Social Been having fun on my dates. Fucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. Date 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day ""is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?"" Her ""Woooow, you are cut throat"" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said ""Got it"" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. Date 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted. Date 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. Date 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. Out of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning. ###Marriage STBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. ""It should have gone to our joint account"" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again so she was upset again. So I told her ""You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself."" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. Nothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. ###Goals Don't let on that I know about her indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (14 week streak) Plating OPSEC (2 week streak) Go to at least one Social activity without family. (3 week streak) Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (9 week streak)"
"**OYS 38** Age 64 Ht 5'11"" Wt 173 Wife 66 Married 43 Together 46 **Physical** Apparently my gym (24 Hour Fitness) will be declaring bankruptcy. **Reading** Models, TRM:PM Began working on the demographics exercise from Models - what am I? Who is in my sphere, my ""demographic"" and thus who might be attracted to me? Business women who travel 100%? That would be the woman who picked me up last year. Its still academic as NYC is talking about a July or August opening. As I worked on it a question occurred to me: Is wife in the demographic that would be attracted to me? Spoiler: no. **Mindset** Maybe it was due to being stuck with no female interaction other then wife, but I need to own the fail day I had last week that was off/on for almost the entire day: While reading thru a disassembly of some hapless n00b in the comments in askMRP I realized I've still got a lot of work still to do myself. PON helped me realize how tied up my ego is in ""being the victim"". And I've been working on the exercises for that. But I'm like Alex j Anderson's passive aggressive evil twin. I'm the unicorn that should not have been cheated on. I'm the only one ever to deal with an alpha widow, etc, etc. Each time I started down this mental spiral I was able to stop - for a time, but then it would sneak back in. The siren call of the self-pitying mope. On the positive side, I have the tools to deal with this, I kept all this to myself (at least I think I did), and I appear to have a ""floor"" that I can climb back up from. **Relationship** It was pointed out to me in last week's comments that she's probably faking it: She's most likely still not attracted to me - she's doing it out of obligation, or to keep me from being Billy Beta Butthurt, etc. Was I trying to ""prove"" something? Be better than him? Am I keeping ""score""? I was for a while, but now I focus on what I feel like. I keep the pedal down on polarity and let it play out however it will. Overall I find myself laughing at the pathetic loser I used to be, and probably still am. The day after that fail day I actually laughed out loud thinking back to it. What a waste of time that was. I think that may be my mission: to just enjoy myself. Stop taking myself, or what she thinks, with any seriousness whatsoever. Instead just laugh. Too much other shit going on to get hung up on this ""relationship"" crap."

WISNIFG Learnt a better way of communicating, I am not anymore the conversation finisher. Letting the hamster DEER is better than confronting it. MMSLP Got horny just by imagining doing all the things there. Shit, I need to lift now. The rational male Year One Oneitis, plates, game, hypergamy, frame so much wisdom there. NMMNG - I understood I have been a nice guy for life. I learned to listen and to be more assertive during conversations. Listen more. The Game - it was an insightful book. I was expecting a guy bragging on how easy he picks up girls. I read an inner trip with lots of useful reflections. Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill It will be a long journey for a career beta like me. MRP Beginner's Guide for the Career Beta I want to read again in a few months and be proud of how far I have gone. Currently reading: not really reading, just latest posts in MRP and askMRP, I have too much things to do to catch up with my goals Reading queue: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius I kind of like stoicism. Getting worried about mundane things is like when a small baby have a tantrum over a random toy. The Mindful Attraction Plan (stalled) Book of pook (stalled) Audiobooks: TWOTSM I followed HornsOfApathys advice and I am listening to audiobooks while training. Book is inspiring, too deep/god focused, maybe I am still not ready, but I am enjoying the explanations. **Myself:** Confinement. Routine. Wake up. Kids tasks. Cook. Work tasks. Food. Train or not. Projects or laziness in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Hey, I built a wall. No, not an emotional wall you feelings-porn-seeker, a real one with bricks and mortar. For being a first time I feel really proud. I build things. I am a man now. For the DoD challenge, I keep working out, diet is not soo bad and of course I shower and shave every day you disgusting faggots! Keeping house a bit better, but I need to do some tasks none of my children (including wife) feel responsible for. They will. Because I will guide them. I have been busy with myself. Changes and habits take some time to settle, so I did not feel like writing weekly. It might sound like an excuse, but I did not want to repeat myself. Still, from time to time is good to write down to keep the pulse (and get some kick in the ass from wiser men). I own that I need to improve with the kids. I could be better and schedule better and be stricter and plan better and guide better but they are kids and are trapped here, so I let them slip a bit from schedule and be kids. Still, there is room to improvement and I will go for it. A bit stricter in the mornings and more playful in the afternoons, that will be me. Time is scarce due to the fact that I am supposed to be working and dealing with kiddos at the same time, and this is not possible. So I work afternoons after wife comes back from the job. I am still searching for my mission. By listening TWOTSM I had to stop lifting for a few minutes and list all the shit I like to do, I want to do, and there are a lot of things, but no real legacy yet. Nothing tells me go for it, they are still a bunch of long-term things I want to do. I will choose some things and see if it brings me to a better sense of mission. **Current goals:** * Reach 1000 lbs club: deadlifting heavy is the best feeling I have in life. I cannot explain it but if I had to do a personal record or fuck, I would go for deadlifting (iron oneitis?). Max 1RM theoretic calculations put me in 800. I will try when it says 1100. * Play guitar. And sing. I will be a rock star. Yeah I also dont believe it, but it is fucking fun. * Be consistent with my working, training, household, etc. I need to put it as a goal because being the best me is part of my mission. **Relationship:** I am surprised on how unemotional I have become regarding my relationship most of the time. No, really, not angry anymore, no fear or whatever. I was over-sensitized lately and jumping at every bone. I somehow dont care about many things that would have had me angry and emotional regarding the relationship. I kind of see shit tests and am sorry, what?, you expect me to react to that?. Old me would DEER and whine and justify and make things rational and explain and prove and try and on and on but new(TM?) me is kind of whatever IDNGAF. And the best is that I mean it. My relationship is still really important to me, but the explosions/situations of the moment are not interesting me at all. Too much shit to do to be bothered I guess I am now at 80% of the time with this attitude, 20% resentment. This 80% is not rambo, it includes initiating, relaxed attitude dude this confinement has been a blessing in disguise for me. The 20% are still my insecurities and fears and still being angry for not getting the treatment I deserve and fuck the noise, I just STFU and it disappears after some time. I am kind of relieved I am not in the emotional roller-coaster anymore. We are still not talking about us, but I am not sure I want to taaaaalk anymore. We share time together, play with the children, have some interesting non-relationship conversations, watch some serial together, pair of sexy times a week (I want more, and I dont get butthurt when rejected most of the time)... a standard blueish relationship. If she is fucking around or hiding things/lying is her fucking problem, fuck her (I still have oneitis, so I am trying to fake it until I make it). Not where I want to be, but far better than before. I take my time for myself and she is not the center of the universe, the center of the universe is again that marvelous land called Fraggle Rock or me, better me. **Lifting:** \#60DoD Weights are improving. I was lying to myself in the first OYS about my weights, this is where I though I was. Well, I was not close, I injured myself because I was too proud to lower the weights and do proper form, recovered and now my lifts are where I really am, proper form and at a minimum x5. I am fine with that and getting in a good shape. Doing Phraks Greyskull LP Variant and adding some shoulder and back exercises alternating days, plus some abs. Still a bit of fat, but I look better in pictures than two months ago. I had not decided in my last OYS if reducing body fat or going for increasing strength. I will go for the strength, I felt miserable when I tried to cut calories. And the mirror shows me a better body now, so even at the same BF% there is a huge difference. **Diet & habits:** I feel better and more energetic when I eat in a surplus. I will not go go-mad, but will keep calories high for now. I stopped cigarettes completely. They are disgusting now. Weed is reduced to evenings with wife, but I am also cutting that from last night (not even a goodbye joint, I stopped already). I dont drink, so I will go back to weed for recreational purposes, but I need at least a full clean month before considering that for now. I have enough rest, but I am not sleeping my 8 hours. I need to schedule myself better now that I am really doing things. **Financial:** We share expenses. No change here. I started to do projects with the computer. Nothing that can create money yet, but the skills I need to build them will put me on the right track. **Social:** With the virus outbreak I am isolated at home with the kids. That is making social interaction scarce. Some video calls at work and with groups of friends, but they are not the real thing."
"**NMMNG** **Breaking Free Activity 7:** can people see my imperfections and still love me? How would I be different if I knew the people I care about would never leave/stop loving me? * On an intellectual level yes but it doesnt feel that way. What else is there to love other than how I give to them and if I have imperfections then I am giving less. The bit about people being attracted to another persons life energy resonated with me, I used to have that but I seem to have lost it to a large degree. The work Im doing here is bringing it back. * I would say what I thought, I would express myself authentically, I would not consider how they would react before speaking. I wouldnt pass everything through the will it piss them off filter, I would not try and prove how useful I am, I would just act in line with my authentic self rather than towards getting a specific action from them. **Breaking Free Activity 8:** Validating behavior to stop/increase. * Im not in a relationship so that eliminated a lot of my normal validation seeking behavior. I picked seeking validation from women on apps as this is something I was working on anyway. I am cutting that out. * When I was doing it more, I felt distracted and like I was always chasing something. I was living outside myself and I felt pulled in all different directions. This was because I was responding to something external without any internal sense of direction. My whole being was reacting to the whims of how some random women reacted towards me. **Breaking Free Activity 9:** Something I wanted to do for myself. Struggled with this one, I have a lot of hang-ups about what I want to do. Being selfish seems a terrible thing to be. There are a bunch of sex things but Im worried that is validation at this point, do I want to fuck a 19 year old for validation or because I just want to? Probably both. * Get a nice car * Get tailored suite + shirts * Fuck a 19 year old * Rally driving course * Beach resort holiday * Allow myself to be what I am * Camping on beach for a month Need to revisit this activity at some point, this list is pretty lame. **Breaking Free Activity 10:** affirmations. The ones that work for me are listed below. I say these before bed during my 10min med. * I am lovable just as I am * My needs matter * I do not break * I am my own judge * I am consistently improving myself and my life * I am deeply connected to all things in life * I let fear pass through me * I focus and apply myself towards my goals * I like and respect myself **Breaking Free Activity 11: Go on a retreat alone.** During lockdown this is not viable. Having said that, I regularly spend time alone, camping alone etc and this is some of the most stress free and enjoyable time for me. **Breaking Free Activity 12**: Do you believe its ok to have needs? Do you belief people want to help you meet your needs? Do you believe this world is a place of abundance? * No to all three questions. * I remember hiding myself away as a kid and feeling embarrassed of needing anything emotionally. At the same time, I dont want to become more needy. Im not sure how to balance these two, I need to understand how to be self-reliant and not needy but at the same time recognize and act on my needs. * Re people meeting your needs, Im not sure what I think, really at the end of the day it is an exchange of value. If they get what they want from you they will give in return. * I think fear is at the root of my scarcity. I close up to the world to protect myself and so the world is closed to me. When I was a kid, there was money scarcity, I was given messages that having nice things (like a nice car) was selfish, when I was a teen/early 20s there was women scarcity (and money scarcity!) and now I have a general scarcity attitude. I am starting to open up from this, seeing there are plenty of women, friends and opportunities in life. Im still not there on the money."

Ignore the red pill?Should I ignore the alpha male & friends zone & or nice guy or the simp/beta red pill/MGTOW advice? And should I avoid those people who believe in that way of thinking? Dont want to waste my time with such people nor waste time dragging people outta that toxic ideology. Dont want to go anywhere near philosophy or anyone who believes in that philosophy.
"The Rep Pill is one of the many philosophies and thinking out there. Should you ignore it? Dunno. What is the situation that you're trying to solve? Define the situation, formulate the question(s) that you want to have address then start looking for answers, google is your friend. > Dont want to waste my time You're going to read/study/try many things; most of them won't work for you... waste of time? Not at all, it's all part of the process. You could start with Female Dating Strategy, see what women there advocate, maybe that will work for you; I understand that you're a guy but that will give you an idea of what that group of women want and advocate. YMMV"
I just want to avoid the alpha male & friends zone bull.
"> I just want to avoid the alpha male That's very easy, one you see one, just walk away from them. > I just want to avoid the ... & friends zone bull. Well, you have control over this one too; friendsone happens when your interest in a woman is unreciprocated and she says ""I see you as a friend, let's remain friends"". At which point you can accept or not. It's in your power. Easy!"
"The short answer is yes. Especially since you already state that you don't want to go anywhere near that philosophy - of course the natural way to do that is to ignore it/not socialise with people who hold those beliefs. Obviously, sometimes you'll meet people who hold some of those beliefs and you still get on with them - it's up to you if you make it a strict rule or have more leniency there. But, if you don't want to mix with toxic ideology, then yes, you should ignore the advice from trp and similar areas."
"Just have self respect, boundaries, and expect equality in relationships with women. Then you can ignore Redpill, Alpha, friendzoned concepts."
Yes I wish people respected that.
"There is a bit truth in everything, altough the ""alpha males"" are all followers."
Its just toxic & everyone sounds sou bitter & hateful.
"Yes, good idea, ignore it and keep away from it. I think any person you'd want to date is not going to fit into those ideologies because the ideologies are toxic and attract toxic people and create toxic relationships."
"Even when the dad is in the picture, she can still be a terrible prospect for an LTR. For example one of my FBs is 20 yrs old, and her body count is already 25. She loves her dad and has a great relationship with him, but her dad more or less let her do whatever she wants (she even tells him about guys shes fucking). She is a good fwb, but she is an abysmal gf. I've known her for 2 years and she has not been able to keep a relationship going for more than 2 months in that time."
"Oh yea by no means was I etching commandments into stone, just a baseline. The modern mind of a woman is a maze and its your job as a man to navigate it quickly. I was in my home town recently, father fell and broke his hip, and the amount of women from high school literally willing to just open their legs for me was disgusting. Sex is the new handshake. Find a germaphobe."
"It truly is an epidemic, I will never date anyone that I know has used SSRIs. Eventually youll be able to identify these broads solely by the look in their eyes."
"My ex had anxiety and depression and took pills for it. Her father worked away from the family in a different country , so wasnt in the picture too much. I thought I could deal with this shit, maybe even help her get off the pills one day. All I wanted was to make her happy and hoped that she would try her hardest to return the favor. L L L L L L L Shit is very wack dealing with girls who have mental health issues. You try to love them and care for them and then it does get blown back up in your face. Focus on yourself and your mental health. My boy told me that at the beginning of the relationship I was fine and now post break up Im fucked mentally and have to work my way back up. That shit is contagious."
"You wouldn't. It's an awesome feeling. If you want sex, you have sex, and if you find someone who absolutely thrills you, then you get into a relationship. And, it's usually a pretty solid one, because it's based out of genuine respect instead of need. So, you stop needing girls, but you might end up wanting a certain girl, if she jives with what you want out of life. And if not, so be it--it stopped being critical to your happiness long ago."
">meone who absolutely thrills you, then you get into a relationship. And, it's usually a pretty solid one, beca This is a great answer."
"You're right. You wouldn't *need* girls, ever. But you'd still *want* them. Not being needy doesn't mean not having any desire whatsoever for a woman. It just means being completely ok if you don't get one. Its like your favorite food. You could probably live without it and if you don't get it tomorrow you'll likely be fine but you still want it and you'll still wanna eat it at multiple points in your life. You wouldn't *need* a girl if you're at a certain point of clarity but you'd certainly appreciate having certain ones. Relationships are just great. I'm not talking about monogamy or even anything sexual/romantic. I mean relationships in general. Thinking that the only relationships that would be fulfilling to you are relationships with men is as misguided as some radicalized women thinking all the world needs is women. Sure, you'll definitely have fulfilling relationships with men but there are relationships to have with women that are as fulfilling if not more so that can't be duplicated by a man no matter what and vice versa. It's just the way we were made. The world wasn't made to have only one sex, it was made to have 2. And we weren't made to be apart, we were made to be together."
You wouldnt and dont
"What an odd question, though not unexpected from this community. Women exist for more than just sex and your validation. If you can't see value in having them in your life as people, if you can't see any value in relationships, I don't know what to tell you. This is why women are grossed and creeped out by these kind of communities. If you don't value women then I guess no, you don't need them, but you are going to miss out on a lot of amazing people and experiences in your life"

"I dont think this is an odd, gross or creepy question. I have asked myself the same thing several times. I dont think OP is questioning the value of women as a gender or in general. As I understand it, hes asking what value or experiences a female partner would add to his life if it was already great. Its a valid question, especially if he hasnt experienced that combination yet. I know I havent had that luck."

"How to/when to negotiate?My husband and I are about to move in to a new home. I have really wanted a new dining table for 2 years. He's always said we don't have the money for it. I don't like the style and it was purchased for and came from the home he shared with his ex. Now, he wants to purchase two cellular shades to cover two windows in the living room. The shades cost $400 just for two! (we thought it would cost half as much) The dining tables I'm interested in costs $450-$500. When we realized the price I messaged him that its really expensive and asked if we could get a different type of cellular shades or use curtains for now. I also said I'd rather spend that amount of money on a dining table. He responded with that he would appreciate the blinds more and that we can go buy them today. He makes way more money than I do. I work reduced hours because of the virus but my hours have fluctuated between full and part time. I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine. I'm upset. Should I attempt to negotiate or since I make less, just not say anything?"
"I'm not familiar with the prices in the US so my opinion probably won't be that relevant... but yeah, $400 for two blinds DOES seem like a lot. From what you're telling us, I absolutely have a feeling that he doesn't care much about your opinion in this matter. If you expressed that buying a new table is important to you, the response shouldn't be ""ok anyway let's buy the blinds today"". That's just not how a discussion between two adult people works. Especially when you are both working so it's not like it's ""only his money"" that will be spent. I would definitely want to have a discussion about it and try to make him see my point."
"It seems, just from what OP has posted, that he's used to getting his way on things like this. If that's the case, I definitely think it's worthy of discussion."
Turns out he doesn't care about my opinion. He laughed at me twice when I calmly and respectfully asked if we could have a discussion about it. He says he refuses to compromise because the comparison isn't equal.
Well... the only responses I have aren't appropriate for this sub. I'm sorry OP.
"Is this really the hill you want to die on? Is he regularly dismissive of your desires, or is it just the table? Are you always this intense about furniture? (no judgment if you are, personally I don't truly care as long as it's clean, but some ppl reaeally get in to home dec) Is this your way of trying to make him proof you matter more than his ex? Or that you matter at all? What other indicators are there that you do or do not matter? So many questions. Typically I would say, you made your desires clear, he has taken them into account and decided not to indulge them, accept and move on. But something that seems so trivial on the surface (a table???) might have some deeper reasons...?"
"I typically concede when we are discussing things. I'm not typically the one that has a strong desire for something. I'm very much into home decorating. No, it has nothing to do with how he feels about his ex. The table is drastically different from the rest of our home. Imagine a bright pink antique table in the middle of a modern black and white house, it matches and fits the home they had together but not ours. I don't think it's him ""indulging"" my desires, since the blinds would require I ""indulge"" his."
"I am certain that someone is going to chime in and ask you if this is really a big enough deal to make a fuss over... but that's really only up to you and maybe the answer is yes. My husband has such a strong personality that I sometimes feel like he steamrolls me and it most often manifests in his telling me we can't afford something that costs $20 and then buying himself a $20 bottle of whiskey. I am familiar with this disagreement. We've made progress, though. > I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine. First, it's irrelevant who makes more money, if you're not keeping your income separate. I make 20k more than my husband and I don't get to use that in arguments. Second, it feels like he's prioritizing his wants over yours, because it's true. He wants what he wants, not what you want and it's as simple as that. I highly doubt he sees this as a sign of disregard or dismissal. He just wants some blinds and you already have a table. If you want to make progress on this issue, particularly if it's recurring and not just this one thing, you need to *calmly* explain how this makes you feel. This was his ex's table and you don't like it and have been wanting to replace it for years, to his refusal, and now you especially don't want to take it to a new house. You clearly have the expendable income and you've wanted to replace the table for longer than he's wanted blinds. You'd really like to get the table and make blinds the next big purchase. Perhaps you can sell the current table and put that money toward it. I also think it's worth mentioning that his response came off as really dismissive. The key here is to politely refuse to go pick up the blinds before talking about it, so you don't just end up with new blinds. Then calmly tell him how you feel without assuming he intended any of it. Then work together to reach a compromise. If you can't get the table now, because there's some reason the blinds must come first, then when can you? Can you start setting money aside with his blessing?"
"> He makes way more money than I do. I work reduced hours because of the virus but my hours have fluctuated between full and part time. I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine. I'm upset. Should I attempt to negotiate or since I make less, just not say anything? Why not buy it yourself in this case and end the discussion? In the US any part-time job pays you more than 500$ or do you assume he has to pay for the furniture? It seems like the whole point is not about money but that you want him to sacrifice something he desires himself to show you his love."
Our money is pooled together. We don't spend that much money without discussing with each other. I'm not asking him to sacrifice. I would like a table and he would like the blinds. They cost about the same. We have the ability to get both and I proposed that.
"Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city. I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity. I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth. I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago. Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men. I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily. Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted. A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time. I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned: \- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness. \- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity. \- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with. \- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles. \- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood. \- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood. \- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women. \- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc. \- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities. \- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc. \- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice. \- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play. \- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina. \- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us. \- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible."
"can I ask, do you live alone? as a young gay guy who still lives with family, and who has 0 aspirations in life, I find it really hard to give myself the drive to make anything of myself, as I'm not motivated by wealth or status. for years, I kind of aspired to one day have an ltr without kids due to my extreme loneliness, but I have difficulty in seeing the point in that as well now. the only thing that even slightly motivates me now is moving out one day so I can have the sex life I've always wanted, but that isn't really gratifying long term. I don't see a reason why I should ever leave my mom's basement unironically, especially since I am barely able to support myself financially as it is. Teen me always wanted to form a deep connection with someone, but after trp, I just feel crushed. life just seems like a very long, dangerous, and lonely road that leads nowhere."
Discrimination against men in the legal system is 6 times worse than discrimination against minorities
"Important to note: that graph doesn't acxount for the fact that men are more likely to commit crimes, and also isn't about the legal system but police killing."
"> more likely to commit crimes If you ask sociologists, it's about being more likely to be accused and sentenced for crimes. Also something about discrimination in the first place, and less verbal and social skills making them have more difficult time to defend themselves against accusation. Some will go on with religious beliefs about patriarchy and toxic masculinity. If you ask evolutionary psychologists, it's about status and access to women, in other words men committing crimes for the benefit of women or for their positive attention. Regardless, even normalized for the same crimes, out of the accused, men are disproportionally more often sentenced than women and out of the sentenced ones, they're getting harsher sentences than women. Men are also less likely to get any help and are discriminated against by the police when they're victims of crimes. It goes on and on, and the OP of the crossposted article has plenty of good sources, also see the bonus sources chapter. All in all, the society is rigged against men in various ways, which makes men discriminated against in almost any aspect of society."
This is part of the female privilege that doesn't get talked about.
Thanks for the cross post. Someone should go to the feminism subreddit and ask them about it. Stuff like this is why fighting united to improve the situation for all and create actual real equality is the way to go.
Do you care to elaborate? (I am basically new to all this) Because my gut feeling would have been that the situation wasn't significantly different throughout the last century before feminism became as popular as it is today. But again that's a gut feeling so obviously please correct me if I am wrong. :D
Second and third wave feminists required special treatment for women and various kinds of gendered language and concepts in legal systems and got them. Discrimination in the form of affirmative action are also of their doing. Laws used to be written in gender neutral fashion before that.
Okay didn't know about that. Thank you.
"Why do so many women tolerate and even encourage casual sexism from their friends/boyfriendsI am a woman myself. I was sexually harassed by a guy in my campus and the entire incident was caught on CCTV cameras, so when I reported he was suspended but got off without any punishment by using a legal loophole in the campus rules. Knowing this and the existence of this proof even having seen it themselves in some cases, I still see the same women becoming his friends and hanging out with him as if it's totally normal. He never apologized he denied the whole incident and then went ahead to spread rumours about me being a ""characterless"" woman, who was drunk and delusional. Not just this, the popular girls here the ones that are considered nice and you know not problematic or feminist like me, are usually the ones who allow casual sexism, laugh at sexist jokes, and basically appease men. I have tried hanging out in these groups or been forced on several occasions, and I've been put off by the huge amount of shit that these girls are putting up with. And when I bring it up they make excuses and they say it's how boys are. I'm sick and tired, I've never been able to have female friends, just a couple of them. I'm tired of the normalisation of this behaviour. Why would any woman play against her own team, why would she support molesters? Why are they so scared of even trying to understand what feminism stands for? Edit: he was not someone who had more social capital at least within the sophisticated circles, also most of the women whose behaviour I'm questioning are themselves in better positions of power than the men they were trying to appease"
Are you familiar with [the patriarchal bargain](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Patriarchal_bargain)?
"When youre stuck inside patriarchy participating in it can protect you and reward you in some limited ways. Women sometimes laugh at sexist jokes because challenging them would be socially dangerous and sometimes physically dangerous. Women sometimes support abusers over victims because those abusers hold more social capital than their victims. This is an extreme example but consider Harvey Weinstein - the few women who did report him early on lost their careers because of the power he held in the film industry. Other actresses who *definitely* were aware of his behavior continued to work with him because if they also spoke out about it theyd be blacklisted as well. A smaller version happens within social circles. The mob is a lot more likely to think a woman a liar than a man, so even if you believe a woman, saying so publicly can put you at the mercy of the mob. The women who are playing against their own team do it because the odds are so much more in favor of the other."
"Internalized misogyny. Same thing that drives not like other girl culture, as well as the poor baby trope."
> poor baby trope oooh what's this about?
"I describe it as the maternal-like trope of girls and women thinking theyre protecting men from the big bad feminists or other women. Its usually common to see around women who are outrageously anti-feminist. Theyre the women who claim that their boyfriend couldnt have raped someone and obviously shes lying for attention, the mothers who believe their sons need to be kept away from gold diggers, the sisters who believe her brother was trapped by someone looking to get pregnant, etc. I just named it such because its a mentality thats very surrounded by oh poor baby, let me protect/take care of you. Youre right, that thing about rape was just a joke, theyre just trying to make you feel bad. Youre a great guy! These feminists have taken it too far! I wont let them hurt you."
"Oh! Kind of like ""[Not My Nigel](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Not_My_Nigel)."" I got ya."
"I had not heard of that, lmao, now I feel dumb. Ultimately, I feel bad for people with such types of internalized misogyny. It seems like it feels very exhausting."
"Thats true! I think I do experience this sort of thing a lot being a feminist. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes I run into anti-feminist women who have the potential to be even more vocal and challenging because they act as if Im some sort of supervillian who hates men and theyre to show me that its not acceptable or something along those lines. I think they think I will listen to what they say simply on the grounds that I am a feminist and they are a woman, so if I dont listen to them and agree, Im a hypocrite."
Alabama bill would criminalize false rape accusations - al.com
"We just have to remember : accusations that are not proven, does NOT automatically mean a false report was filed. As unfortunate as it is, many rapes don't have sufficient evidence. To convict someone of false reporting there has to be evidence proving it was false and malicious"
>To convict someone of false reporting there has to be evidence proving it was false and malicious I don't think anyone (reasonable) wants anything but this
">He or she willfully, knowingly, and with malicious intent, makes a false report of rape Wording right from the bill. This is all we've ever been asking for. It has nothing to do with preventing rape claims and will not affect people who report their rape.. unless they're a lying sack of shit that the feminists keep wanting to defend. Because fuck feminists for defending sacks of shit."
">To convict someone of false reporting there has to be evidence proving it was false and malicious As should be the case of convicting anyone of any crime, including rape. We just want equal standards here. We want justice for people like Brian Banks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football)#False_accusation_of_sexual_assault"
"That's also why I'm here. All I need is there to ensure the continuation for evidence beyond a reasonable doubt for any conviction, and I'm fearful some laws regarding both rape accusations and false rape accusations could begin to ignore this"

yeah wtf i'll give this a look.
Ive listened to the audio book a few time. Honestly a great listen and good practical advice that will yield result if acted on.
"Is the happiness and fulfillment of bottom tier men dependent on the suffering and misery of women?Did I get that right? So we have this ""sexless"" men problem. Of course these guess talk about sex but every-time we say get a prostitute they say the problem is love and intimacy . Something about sympathy because maslows hierarchy of needs aren't being met and a section of men are going to start offing themselves. But there's a reason these guys aren't getting a girlfriend. It's a free market hence very competitive. You are both the product and the sales man. These guys either have shitty products, are shit sales men or both. Basically no woman wants to buy what they're selling. And some set their price too high (they only want hot chicks). And these failed sales men are very sad. They can't get girlfriends/wives. They'll stop working because they'll never have a family. Something something taxes. Then they'll shoot up a couple schools . Did I get that right? Once upon a time it wasn't a free market. Markets were very regulated and women couldn't choose who they wanted to marry. Being young wild and free was shamed. And pre-birthcontrol that lifestyle would have been much harder. Women married men they didn't feel anything for. They had sex with and raised kids for these men. They lived quite lives of servitude and were more or less miserable. Not all women . Just the women who had to marry the bottom tier men. After the sexual revolution women no longer had to date and marry bottom tier men. Online dating was the dating markets version of globalization hence ""Chad( The Chinese) is stealing our women( manufacturing jobs)"". So anyway these men stopped getting sex and we're back to current 2020. It seems there's no middle ground. Either the bottom tier men get wives and are happy and productive while their wives are miserable. Or the women date who they want and are free to be single while bottom tier men suffer from loneliness. Personally I wouldn't want my daughter being forced to date someone so he won't commit suicide or shoot up a school. Edit: Please stop Dming me Again I don't respond to Dms say it in the comment section weirdos"

Nice throwaway alt. I wonder which woman we know here is posting this
the ugly one
[deleted]
Username definitely checks out I don't know that's it's necessary to go back to the old reality but what would probably help this all gel is inculcating people into the new reality in a more straightforward manner. This is America brah we're all about giving everyone the illusion the riches of a few are available to everyone eventually (temporarily embarassed millionaires etc.) People just need to be educated that this is what happens.
"Completely wrong. Its that the bottom tier men are treated like shit by women, yet are still expected to treat these same women with chivalry. Anger and frustration by these men is a byproduct, understandably. When these men see these women feeling their same pain, it may seem bittersweet. Bottom line - Women need to stop having double standards."
Women shouldnt fuck people they dont want to fuck
> yet are still expected to treat these same women with chivalry. in 2020? nah
"Parents who didn't want to have kids - are you happy now?Hi! I have a problem and I need a straightforward advice. I have a question for all the parents who didn't want to have kids and now have them - has life changed for better or for worse? Is it worth having kids? And for all the parents who always wanted to have kids and now regret having them. WHY do you regret it or WHY are you happy? Be honest, please. Me (f28) and my partner (m29) have been together for almost 10 years. Recently we've been having more and more fights about having kids - he doesn't want them and I do. I know you think it's stupid to discuss kids after 10 years of being together. A quick backstory is that when we were dating for about two years, he said to me that he wanted to have a baby with me someday. Over the years he was becoming more and more red pill, saw the negative sides of having kids and told me a few years ago that he doesn't want to have kids (and I get that, there are a lot of bad sides of parenting). The problem is that we love each other so much. We are soulmates. But we know whether we have or we don't have kids, one of us will probably be unhappy. But if I leave him, I know I'll be miserable becuse I love him so much. I also think there is a LOW chance that I meet some other guy who I will love as much as my partner now and who will want to have kids. Me and my partner really get along. I know if I end up leaving him I'll just be miserable. So I am obviously wondering if we ever end up having kids afterall, how much chance there is for him to be happy. (I'm not intending to get pregnant ""by accident"" because that means I'll be intentionally ruining his life.) So ... what's your story? Thanks!"
couldnt stand kids and never wanted them. Sons turning 4 now and I have zero regrets. Its one of the few times ive been happy making sure someone else is happy. Its weird. Its very expensive and rewarding and will scare the shit out of you. AND only do it if the relationship is VERY stable
"Hmm it sounds weird yes haha and a bit hard to understand, but thanks a lot for your reply! Can I ask you something ... when you said you're happy making them happy - were you like that before or totally opposite? Because my partner really really likes his alone time, the sense of freedom etc., and I can't help but think that making someone else happy would just drain him (he's an introvert)."
"It's funny, because he sounds very similar to me around that age. Coincidentally it's also the same age we did make the decision to have a kid. Personally, I regret absolutely nothing. It's amazing the emotional roller coaster that you go through once you do have kids to take care of. I never imagined it possible to love anyone as much as I love these 2 little guys. As a man there is a much deeper sense of meaning in your life that is discovered once you're a father and you would literally die for your kids without even thinking for a second. The responsibility to take care of them and provide for them makes life so much more meaningful and fulfilling and that in itself provides a deep sense of purpose and happiness that I didn't know was possible. This doesn't exist in a life where your only purpose is immediate gratification and pleasure seeking. That will get old very quick and the inevitable existential crisis will be just around the corner. Jordan Peterson's work has really shone a light on that for me."
"That is interesting. Thanks! And thanks of reminding me of Peterson, that's a good point. So what made you change your mind and decide to have a kid?"
"Wife had a meltdown after our first kid that lasted for 3 years so it's not your usual post partum depression. Straight up abusive and aggressive. I swore I'd never have any more kids with her and she agreed. Fast forward few years later she remembers her dream family had 3 kids. She had this vision since she was 9, and wanted it realised here and now. So after a year of bitching I caved. And here we go again, same old shit hit the fan and she started having her fits again. But this time I was slightly red pilled so my response wasn't as hectic as before so it stopped. Do I regret it? Fuck no. I love that little fat porky more than anything in my life now."
"Sorry to hear that, it sounds tough. But I'm happy for you! I'm actually surprised how many people say it's tough and scarry having kids but really worth it. Like fulfilling. I still don't get it how it can be both but I believe it. Thanks for your story!"
[deleted]
"Yea that's the thing, when I have to walk my sister's dog it always feels like such a burden. I love dogs but they're too much work ... but kids are even harder. I mean I always loved kids but I'm scared of being drained out and unhappy. Also I read somewhere that (I don't know if it's a correct number, but it is very high) about 40% of parents wish they made a different decision and never had kids (if they could choose again), although they love their kids and they mean the world to them. So yea, I'm confused. But thanks a lot for your story!"
Didn't want them. Had them. No regret. Split with partner. She took them away from me. Deep regret.
"Books that make you a more attractive person, instead of emotional manipulation and ""game theory""?I've been browsing redpill occasionally, but I don't really subscribe to the theory, what with game theory and the emotional manipulation and whatnot. However, I can't deny that I have not been very successful with women. I think I'm generally rather bad at reading signs, and escalating. I'm not looking for one-night shit anyway, just want to be a bit better at the aforementioned when I meet a girl I might actually be interested in. Can you recommend me some books which can help in that regard, with becoming a more attractive person in general, and a better relationship partner, without the messed up redpill aspects?"
"The book ""Attached"" made a huge difference in my dating life (for the better!) [https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139)"
"I'll check it out, thanks for the suggestion!"
"Another one is ""the like switch"" specifically on the subject of being liked. This one also really worked for me. [https://www.amazon.com/Like-Switch-Influencing-Attracting-Winning/dp/B00RKI81A6](https://www.amazon.com/Like-Switch-Influencing-Attracting-Winning/dp/B00RKI81A6)"
"What do you think about ""how to win friends and influence people""? I've heard a lot about that one too, have you read it?"
My personal favourite books on it are No More Mr Nice Guy by Robert Glover and Models by Mark Manson. It's funny cuz both books are recommended by the RedPill community yet in those books they actively call out the bullshit that resides in their theories.
"I've read Models! I have to be honest though, I didn't like it so much. It basically boiled down to: ""do what you want because you want it, and be honest about your intentions"", right? At least, that's what I remember of it. If that isn't correct, maybe I should re-read it. I've heard about No More Mr Nice Guy, I'll check it out!"
"No book is perfect. There's a couple of things that Mark Manson says that also doesn't resonate with me. I think a more balanced outlook on it is. If you want to get girls, don't manipulate yourself and women to achieve it. Be the person you want to be and you'll naturally become more attractive."
What do you think makes an attractive person? I dont mean what do you think women think is attractive but what do you specifically think.
"Self-confident, no self-destructive habits, easy in conversation, intelligent, physically attractive (obviously), doesn't require attention, to name a couple. For me, I think I have trouble with conversation (I sometimes find it hard to converse with people if I barely know them, unless they're exceptionally good at conversation themselves), and attention. For example, I'd like to not care about whether or not one person gives me attention or not, but I've noticed that if I for example have a crush on a girl, I care a lot and I'll be looking at my phone extremely often to see if they've responded yet. Just typing it out makes me cringe. I hate it and I want to change that."
"Not sure I'm part of the redpill (advice)I'm a male in my very early 20s. I've only been in 1 relationship before (intentionally). I dont believe in sleeping around with random women going clubbing and things like that. I'm a reserved man. After my 1st relationship ended a while ago I've been looking into the redpill ideology. A lot of it did make sense to me , and I saw some aspects of mistakes I made in my 1st relationship which made me lean to it. However I've been through reddit and I've seen some women and a some men totally against TRP. I have a date after this lockdown ends.. and I aim in implementing some of the redpill techniques (not all) . What advice do you guys have? Whether man or woman"
Quit redpill. &#x200B; it is a cult. &#x200B; Speaking as an ex-redpill who survived four years.
4 years? Wow. Do you have any specific advice and how it's a cult? Because I've seen some arguments that seem very convincing. Also I've seen some redpill men that seem very very toxic.
"The Toxicity is self fulfilling and self building. Start with some simple convincing ideas. Get people to buy into it more and more, next thing you know you are basically just a huge toxic asshole. This is how Redpill mentality works. This is how cults work."
"Same, red will place and convince you of one view and one view only, toxicity and bitterness"
"Speaking as old geezer, the red pill was different before incels raided it with their negative attitude and turned it to hate fueled mindset. in general principles, trp message was: be the attractive and assertive man that is desired by men and women as well. strive to be fit, keep the skin clean, dress good (lot of subreddits about it), work on your friend circle, have a hobby that you are passionate about. dont be afraid to stand for yourself, but know when to keep your mouth shut. people take the advice literally with this ""negging"" or holding picture frames (LOL). they go clubbing with mysoginistic attitude and then complain that they did not get laid, lol. trp was much different back then than this crap."
"I've ""learnt"" them in the sense that I believe some of the concepts they teach, ie: \- Women are hypergamous, they place priority on finance and status and stability. But hypergamy isn't the only thing that women care about. Likewise how men don't always care about looks alone. It's complex. \- Alpha F\*\*\* and Beta bucks concept makes sense but **to me it applies to both genders**. I'd also be okay with a really great looking woman who's loyal and supportive and all that, yet fun in bed? ""Alpha males"" just seem to give off the vibe that they would be good in bed anyways so perhaps some women who are feeling it at that point of time would be more inclined for casual sex, in this case when they are ovulating which does seem to be the case even with girls I've talked to about ovulation (good friends so we talk about weird stuff all the time..) \- Spinning plates theory. The number of plates they ask you to have seems abit unnecessary. Nonetheless, having options seems like a good idea. All in all, i just took away the fact that I need to have more self-respect, self-improvement and I need to be more strategic in the sense that I don't subconsciously put a girl on the pedestal just because she ticks some boxes. I just feel that I have to mature and not be too easily charmed by a girl. &#x200B; What do you think? Is it good to have this mentality? If otherwise do share. I'd hope for relationships to be simplistic but it doesn't seem to be the case. Divorce rates have skyrocketed and a lot of unhappy relationships happen, I do not want to be next. I don't know whether I should continue red-pilling. I just get real depressed about it."
"I think basic ideas like looking nice, maybe by working out a bit to attract more women and the psychological stuff to make women more attracted to you work, but I would advise against doing a lot of the psychological manipulation because it is well... manipulation. And it can get to a mentally abusive point with Red Pill ideology. But stuff that's not harmful like working out, looking nice, coming off confident, and tips to help make a connection with a woman or get her to notice you aren't too bad. Stuff like dreading a woman is pretty messed up though. So the basic tips that are perfectly healthy and just increase your chances aren't too bad but when it gets to manipulation which it will, steer clear of that stuff. The ideology, techniques and language Red Pillers believe in and use is designed to warp the perception of men new to the sub of how things really are and get you to doubt yourself and women, see flaws in yourself/dating/women even in normal interactions where there aren't any, and take self doubt and disenfranchisement with dating women and grow and use that to indoctrinate you with their beliefs and turn that into hatred of women. It gets pretty toxic ngl. Just look at some of the ex Red Pill stories about Red Pill ruined a lot of guys relationships, not just romantic but nuked relationships between even years long friends and family, and at the time the guys thought they were doing better because they were drowning in pussy, and every time they were sad because things in their life were fucked up, they leaned more into Red Pill instead of realising that it's normal to be sad when you've burnt down bridges with years long friends and your own family and lots of pussy is not going to solve that."
Wow. I never really thought of it that way. Ur right about taking the good from it like working out and so on. But staying away from the manipulation tactics
"I wanted to post a thread, because I just looked into redpill recently, as a 19 year old guy, I just want to minimize my potential mistakes as much as I can. And I stand with you that some of the ideas make sense. But again, I just started to look into it for a week. I'm hoping to make peace with the whole situation, because redpilling looks like a very shitty route to take. (FYI, I couldn't post the thread, and I'm not sure why because I tried to follow the guidelines, it might just be my karma count because I'm relatively new to reddit as a whole)"

I think it's very egocentric but I get the point
So how does one finds his purpose
"Yes, very true. I'm rewatching the wire, and on season 3 where prez shoots a black cop (again); people are telling him it could be racial, and his father-in-law police major asks prez's black commenting officer lieutenant, Daniels, if Daniels will support prez if the incident turns racial. At first I questioned that Daniels doesn't say anything or ""yes,"" as he knows prez isn't racist, but it actually makes sense Daniels doesn't give a statement there. (He also hates the guy asking him, as he's generally a dick, and Daniels has also talked to prez informally and can see the guy isn't smart with his words, and needs a lawyer) I'm really liking Daniels' character this watch around; he does what's right, eventually, usually, though he plays the game wisely. I also really like how there's displayed racism against white people, particularly politicians like Tommy carcetti, in the show; a lot of corrupt politicians are black people who only associate with other black people too."
"With regard to workplaces, over the years I stopped bringing photos, momentos etc. into my office or cubicle. It was for that reason ... you don't own your job or your office.

"I don't believe this. It's gotta be a troll/bait. But if it isn't... why should I listen to dating advice from a girl like this? They're her preference but she's never dated one? W H Y ??? The sentence itself is just a short circuit. Short guys are her preference... but she cares more about personality... but she just stated she wished her bf could be shorter? Do you care or not? Or is this just virtue signalling (it is.) Like incels get criticized for not listening to women. But I've known so many women who have told me there are girls out there for me, and I ask them about themselves and their friends... *who don't date guys my height* \\ ""\*bUt ThOsE aReN't aLl wOmeN!!1!1"" c'mon"
"well just like short guys get turned down for being short, tall girls also get turned down for being tall, both of those don't make sense but it still happens"
but they do make sense. Both instances are not in line with the desired sexually dimorphic traits.
>tall girls also get turned down for being tall Nowhere near as often as short men
Probably just a troll. I refuse to believe this stupidity could exist in the universe.
"Talk to more people,you'd be unpleasantly surprised."
so it seems that it so just happens in a statistical series of recurrent occurrences recurring way more probably than what could have been previously estimated by mere intuition
But it just so happens
IT JUST SO HAPPENS TEEHEE
"How do I convince redpilled individuals that they are wrong about women and them being Male isn't the problem in their dating life?I don't like redpillers or these MGTOW types they hate women, believe in a heternormitive world and that LGBTQ+ people are irrelevant, they hate anyone that disagrees with them, and they just whine about issues they have no idea that feminism can fix. However no matter how much I will try to convince these people in a debate they will look at me as uneducated and loony almost. For example I got one guy who just kept repeating ""check out Edward Horgon's from Harvard university why women perfer bad boys"" which he didn't link and I didn't get search results. I want to debate these people but they are so stubborn and annoying how do I get people out of the redpilled mentality?"
Why do you need to convince them? Why not spend this energy on something good and productive?
Sometimes I wonder if some of my friends are also secretly in this mentality because some show signs of it and if this is the case I wish to help them out of it
Dont hand out with people if you feel like you have to put up with their bullshit and do all the emotional labour while getting glimpses of hatred towards you and people like you in return. Friendship like any relationship should be mutually pleasant and useful.
yeha i agree. dealing with people like this constantly is almost like a form of masochism.
"You don't need to discuss with them. Don't give them a feeling that their ""opinion"" is valid. Social punishment (aka exclusion) is a valid and quite effective method to stop people from bullshitting"
"if you are that determined, you will be spending a lot of time and energy and patience searching for the sources and counter sources they claim don't exist, and rewording everything. also coping with the belittling and such. and really, some people aren't even looking for debate, they just want to annoy you or think they have to be right all the damn time for no reason."
"What a coincidence, I think of them as irrelevant. Don't waste your breath arguing with these folks. They are immature, and they're not looking to have their minds changed or to have an actual debate. They will either grow out of this mindset over time or get stuck in a shitty place while the rest of the world moves on."
"I know a french channel of MGTOW on youtube, and they're very chill. Some are total a-hole, but most of them are very calm and open to debate. However, i don't think you can convince anyone of anything. Because when people are sure about something that make them feel better about themselves (example with them : ""that's not my fault, it's women's because they are like that!!!""), no matter how hard you try to show them the truth, they will deny it. Only them can convince themselves, and change."
"I think the most important way to convince them if you really want to is to come from a place of sympathy. MRAs may be wrong about many things, but they do come from a place of hurt."
Personality is a synonym for attractiveness
That's why they keep saying it's all about personality.
Finally one of my posts made it through so my brocels can see them. &#x200B; Edit: Thank you brocels for le redit points and awards.
Could you link the source of this whole study?
"It isn't a study, per se. It was just a chart OkCupid released on their blog where they released some interesting statistics. On OkCupid, users take more time looking through users' descriptions along with their profile picture. So OkCupid did an experiment where people rated other users' photos and their personalities based on their description of themselves. Here is the link to that: [https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/weexperimentonhumanbeings.html](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/weexperimentonhumanbeings.html) ."
Thanks a lot! Something caught my eye. Did you see the chart about offline blind dating? I'm confused a bit about that one.
"You do understand that's a dating app, where women can't judge your actual personality, but how they perceive you based on how you look, right? This isn't an actual measure of what your **actual** personality is. It's what people guess based on your looks. If you look good, people are more likely to vote more positively on your personality aswell. Because your brain attaches good looks to something positive. So it naturally makes a false assumption. Wildly different from people seeing how you look, hanging out 3 times with you, and then rating your personality."
It's over.
I support masculism let's challenge the feminists
Thank you for using the proper term. Tired of hearing menenist.
"If you're saying that there are ideas that some people consider to be feminist that aren't good then I agree with you, but masculism isn't meant to be an opposing ideology to feminism. Masculism should be about addressing issues that are especially faced by men, and solving them in such a way that everyone can benefit. Just as an example, there's the example that men are more likely to have physically demanding jobs and to be injured while doing so. If injured working men are being undersupported by society, it's possible that that's rooted in a belief that working men are disposable, and that's something we should challenge not to make people feel ashamed of implicit biases they have, but to solve problems for working men."
I totally agree I don't want conflict I just want a side where all issues on both sides are seen and heard.
"Saying ""let's challenge the feminists"" isn't that, unless you want to specifically challenge feminists who don't believe that men's issues are important on that point in particular."
I want to challenge their dismissivness of gender equality and instead want to be special
You can start by not generalizing entire movements. That doesnt really help any conversation.
"I like the ambition however do try and be wary that we dont need this space to be a gender war space. Try and use it to address why in time and space men are facing unnecessary challenges. Not every problem is because of feminism. For example male conscription can be a feminist issue as well because it seems to have started at a time when women too were viewed as ""too fragile"" or had other unfair gender roles put on them from upper classes etc."
Not trying to cause a gender just pointing out the problems faced by men as well so that gender equality can be seen through both sides
I think the title is misleading towards your goal. Im sure many here feel the same as you

Obviously I thought she was the one, even told my mom that I wanted to marry her lmao. One night we were supposed to meet up but I couldnt because I was baby sitting, she met up with her ex and let him finger bash her in the back of his car (Im certain much more than that happened but she obviously denied it). From that moment I started to realise that I should be valuing myself more and work on making ME the best that I can be. Without that experience I would most likely still be orbiting and validating the next woman who gave me the slightest bit of attention. The takeaway from this whole spiel is that experiences are the most important thing you can learn from and you can choose to dwell over them and let them hold you back or open your eyes and work on yourself."

"polarizing a woman I've known for a while - difficulty: lockdownHello everyone, >TL;DR A girl I've known for a while, with some common friends. How to contact her and chat a bit, making your intentions of going out after the lockdown clear but without sounding like a sex predator or something? I think this is something others are experiencing in this period too So, there is this girl I kinda like, but we have a basic ""hello, how you doin'"" relationship since a while and haven't seen each other in months Now, I'm thinking hell why not contact her, write a bit and polarize the thing, so when the lockdown is over we can go grab a coffee and you know. I can see 2 problems: \* I don't want to come off as creepy, contacting her now after months and we never talked much anyway. I really want a genuine connection BUT \* I don't want to come off as an uninterested friend neither. I mean, while I genuinely enjoy human contact and knowing people, regardless of everything, it should be clear that I am also looking for a more intimate thing, polarize it, that is. I would just invite her for a coffee... if things were normal. But now? Basic question you may ask me: why now after months? Well, I'm a bit insecure and now I'm working on that part of myself, and also yes, I'm bored. And she is cute, and smart. &#x200B; I also considered that now it's not the time in general, and I should just postpone everything to when it's going to be easy to go for a drink. But I would love your take on that Hope I managed to explain myself... texting is not my forte, obviously!"
"Do you follow her on Instagram? If so, send a fun/flirty reply to one of her stories, anything that makes you want to say something so it doesn't seem too out of context that you're texting her after a while. Don't ask her a question. It puts some pressure on her to reply and if she doesn't, you're gonna feel...not nice. Just send her a flirty non-needy statement that makes her know that you were thinking of her. Back and forth for a bit, then suggest going out after the lockdown lifts. In case she doesn't reply, fuck it, move on. Value yourself."
"Hi, no we share a couple of friends group chat, but I do not use socials (facebook, instagram and such). Probably this lockdown could be the moment I reconsider that =D"

This year the number is expected to grow to over 20 million. > When China joins the W.T.O., by 2005 it will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, making the tools of communication even cheaper, better, and more widely available. We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China. > Now there's no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. Good luck! That's sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall. But I would argue to you that their effort to do that just proves how real these changes are and how much they threaten the status quo. It's not an argument for slowing down the effort to bring China into the world, it's an argument for accelerating that effort. In the knowledge economy, economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand. \-Bill Clinton, 2000"

"Talk To Women - Keep It SiimpleDon't make the male/female interaction more complicated than what it has to be. Eye contact Greet Small Talk Farewell/Contact Info Get out of your head, be in the present moment, and pay attention to your environment and the person in front of you. Eye contact is how women convey interest. If she locks eye contact with you, chances are she's interested enough to at least talk to you. Master eye contact and you'll notice you're having more and more success with women. Greetings are very natural and gives off a warm vibe. Don't try to sound sexy or cool. A ""good morning"" with good eye contact will get you better results than trying to be funny, interesting or cool. Especially if you see the person frequently. Small talk is when you can throw in your wittiness. Her: ""Every time I see you you're drinking coffee"" You: ""So how long have you had your eye on me?"" said with a smile. Don't expect fireworks, just observe her reaction. Farewells don't require a hug or a kiss. I know ""kiss closing"" is your goal, but you could kiss somebody today and she could be kissing someone new tomorrow. It's not an accomplishment. If you want to speak to her again, just get her social media info or phone number. With social media, you can see what kind of person she is a little more. You'll know if it has the potential to go further than a one-night stand or not if you actually do get to fuck. Apply the K.I.S.S principle - Keep It Simple, Son."

"Do you girls know any clothing brand that are both comfy and feminine?I spent all my teenage years spitting on femininity, I didn't care much about my looks and I want to improve that (I still want the clothes to be comfortable though) Or if you have any fashion advice generally speaking"
"First of all, I love your username. I have one of my college show choir pieces stuck in my head now. I dont know a specific brand necessarily but when I want to be comfy and feminine, I love maxi dresses now that its warmer, or fit and flare or fitted t shirt dresses year round (I live in a warm climate but you could wear them with tights or thigh socks for a colder climate) and when its colder I like leggings with soft feminine tunics or cardigans. You can be plenty feminine in jeans as well. I know a lot of the world considers them comfy. I love them and wear them a lot but dont see how anyone thinks theyre comfy. All you need is a girly top and some heels or ankle boots. You definitely never need to sacrifice comfort for femininity."
"I replaced the l with a capital i lmao I actually never wore maxi dresses, it looks both feminine and classy, it's perfect I'm not comfortable wearing short tight dresses because it makes me feel like I'm just asking for male attention so I'll definitely buy some, thanks for the advice ! Yeeah, flaire t shirt dresses can look so good just with a simple belt, and high socks, I'll definitely look into that too The combo mom jean (I really hate jean when they're so tight they restrict my movements) and flattering top is indeed a killer Thank you so much for your advices I'm also looking into color schemes, like wearing light and pastel colors, god this is so fun, I feel like I'm learning a whole new discipline"
"Dresses, dresses, dresses. Find the shape that fits you best and buy them in every color. It's the closest you'll get to wearing a night shirt in public and people will think you're trying *harder.*"
That's actually so clever
Ayyy Orthodox Gang! Sezane is my new favorite right now. Its about $100/piece and made in small batches each month so they sell out quick; its not a fast fashion brand. It has a very vintage European look. I find that its similar to Rouje and Reformation without being so immodest.
Thanks I'll look that up!
"Yes, big agree here. Sezane is a great brand."
"Little Women Atelier has some of the dreamiest feminine linen dresses, Im saving up for my next one and a matching apron! I also frequent Hearts and Found since I enjoy the 1950s style. Both of these shops can be found on Etsy. My tips would be ease into it, I used to be uncomfortable going out in dresses (felt overdressed), let alone skirts that went past my knee. I bought some cheaper transition pieces from department shops until I built my confidence and particular style up! Good luck!"
Athleta! I just cant afford it but I LOVE their stuff!
What are your thoughts on pornography?
Cool if produced ethically.
It's fine if there is nothing illegal in it
"Should be legal, but the industry should be better regulated to ensure that none of the performers are being exploited. Particularly for young and naive girls, the porn industry can be so brutal. Few actors are able to make a real career of it, and any involvement leads you down a path where society shuns you. There is no such thing as only doing porn for a few years to get you through college, but that's an idea that some people seem to have when they do it. When porn comes up in your background check, you aren't getting the job, and now there's barely any money in porn at all. Free porn is everywhere, and this has a serious impact on actor pay. &#x200B; You can't stop porn. It's fundamentally an agreement between several consenting adults, to perform an act, usually for monetary compensation, but there are some couples who do it because that's their thing. If people are consenting to doing it, and people are consenting to watching, and nobody is being unduly harmed by anyone else, then who I am to stop it. That said, I think we should produce and consume much less of it. It's already proven to have a bad impact on the mental health and sexual performance of those who consume it too often, and it's been show to have addictive properties."
"The pay one is also quite dangerous as in order to get paid the ""actresses"" have to do more and more extreme scenes."
"The other thing now with the internet being involved is that it can be shot anywhere in the world, so it is actually cheaper for these companies to go out to less well off areas and offer the women there next to nothing for extreme scenes. This is going to sound off of me, but it's been covered by real documentaries, notably a series on sex work by channel four, but there is a problem in the sex work industry of women from poor(er) countries coming in and undercutting the whole market. They don't know what their bodies are worth, so they undersell them, and it brings the whole market price down, screwing everyone. One line that stuck with me was that in this one city in the UK, it used to be that you could go to that seedy part of town and pay someone 20 for a blowjob, but then a load of poor eastern european women arrived and started selling anal for 5, and literally anything goes for 10/hour. It wrecked the whole scene. It makes an industry already susceptible to exploitation and corruption, even more exploitative."
what are your thoughts on pornography?
"Negative. It normalizes violence in relationships, encourages misogyny in non sexual situations, and the majority of it is produced with coercion, human trafficking and blackmailing. It also has a whole host of negative effects on the brain, and is like a drug addiction. It starts out vanilla but in order to get off the person will need more and more severe shot. Also the vast majority of porn sites are all owned by one company Mindgeek, and all of its sites have had countless cases of their being videos of actual rapes, videos of minors, and even if toddlers being abused on it that they either refused to take down or only took down once a lawyer was brought in. There is also the fact that people are being exposed younger and younger to it, the average age being 8-11. Most people ik were exposed at around 9 or 10, and that was years ago. Masturbation itself isn't bad, but its more the port industry and how porn messes people up. Areas with onlyfans its a parasocial relationship that doesn't use trafficking and doesn't seem to be anywhere near as violent. https://fightthenewdrug.org/ has a ton of information on pornagraphy."
"> the majority of it is produced with coercion, human trafficking and blackmailing. Did you mean this literally? Do you actually think more than 50% of porn is coerced, trafficked, or blackmailed porn?"
Yes. The porn industry is riddled with it.
Great article looking forward to more similarities.
Honestly I feel like I would lose interest if this was used on me. Why would I put time and effort into getting to know someone who doesnt seem to want to talk to me or be around me for more than short bursts? How long does this go on and do things ever change? I dont understand how being seemingly uninterested in her would make her want you any more than being a decent person would. Maybe I just dont understand it the way you phrased it?
"Being that you have questions, my guess is it's been done to you... and it worked."
"No, everyone I've been in a relationship with made an effort to talk with me and spend time with me whenever our plans allowed. It's one thing for two people to not communicate because they have different lives, it's a different thing to not communicate because you think it makes the other person want you more. I put alot of work in to relationships and making my SO happy, I'd be devastated if he were to treat me like this."
Okay.
"Thats a bold guess, not all women will fall for what you're saying. I understand what you're saying, I have done it. Making women the needy ones really puts me in a comfortable place. But some women are inmune to this, they are either too shy to express themselves or find this distant demeanor unappealing."
I just want to add that you should start light with this. Ive made some horrible blunders in my life by basically downright insulting women and I can tell you it does not turn them on to be called a horse face lol. I still cringe thinking back on what an asshole I was. Theres a difference between teasing and being a douchebag.

I feel like I'm seeing this stuff everywhere from the self-denial cucks on the relationships\_advice thread to the rise of shameless simps on Onlyfans. I know the RP response will be to ignore it, laugh at them, and focus on your purpose (which is good advice) but is the active crumbling of western masculinity not bothering to anyone else?"
"You notice it more after reading trp, that doesnt mean that the world is changing"
What you are witnessing can be defined as beta but is better so seen as a world lacking authenticity. We are a populace of duct taped solutions. Lacking masculinity? Try this brand. Try this pill.

"What about being male puts them at risk? In China, despite low obesity, a high percentage of males are smokers which brings greater risk of COVID complications. Are we to infer its a biological mechanism now?"
I like this comment in the source post by u/eigenman Honestly I'm thinking that if covid is causing blood clots in the small blood vessels in the lungs that it's more about oxygen not getting to everything. Men have more muscle mass and thus are affected more by oxygen deprivation. I see this at high altitudes a lot. It's always the big muscle bound guys that go hypoxic the easiest. If they are overweight then it's just worse. Literally the less mass you have the less oxygen you need. Same goes for dehydration. The bigger you are the harder you fall. I live at 9k feet so it's something I see a lot. Of course just my opinion.

"I found Sarah Thereses YouTube channel after a whole bunch of feminists were upset about her being pro-life and loving her husband.https://www.youtube.com/user/SarahHeartsSparkle Its awesome, very self improvement focused and life style orientated. She has a emphasis on being feminine. She is a young Wife and mother of 3 children."
I love her videos! She has such a positive energy I can feel through the screen
So inspirational!
"Incredibly! Its often hard to find role models as a young woman, so Im always on the look out for people like her"
Why is it no one is allowed to have their own opinion
Yeahhhhhhh I liked her til I saw her home birth vid and she stares at the camera like.... its all about the clout..... while pushing out a baby. Idk maybe Im too young for her stuff but that was a NOPE for me.
"\>Unfortunately, shes very hard to watch for me personally, because of her antivax, anti-LGBTQIA positions. I can stand her in very small doses. &#x200B; I feel like that about a lot of these public trad-wifey figures. Frustrating, but what can you do?"
Honestly she sounds lovely! I will take a look at her channel
"Lol, I first found her channel because I'm a minimalist and YouTube started recommending a bunch of minimalism videos. She has a lot of content about that as well. I see she's almost at 1 million subscribers! Good for her :) She was nowhere near that when I first stumbled across her page. & feminists are generally miserable anyway."
"Do you ever feel alienated as a POC feminist?Sometimes I, as an Asian woman who has never moved away from my home country feel alienated. And its almost embarrassing to state my struggles because theyre polars apart from other feminists, and also the sense of shame that comes with showing the wounds from an extremely misogynistic society when a majority of places are much safer. What to do about this?"
"Short answer, yes. Long answer, I moved countries so I do not know if my experience is relevant. I understand that my struggles and perspective are different from other people's and usually try to keep out of general discussions. This is not because I disagree with the principle but sometimes with the solutions. While feminism is a global movement, solutions need to take into account the specificity of local culture and history. If you are feeling alienated by feminists in your own country, then I think your local intersectional feminist groups may help. I took the liberty of reading a bit more into your post. If you are personally struggling with the ""sense of shame that comes with showing the wounds from an extremely misogynistic society when a majority of places are much safer"" then may be a support group would more be beneficial than activist groups?"
Intersectional feminist support sounds like just what OP is looking for! There are groups that will welcome the new perspective of someone who has experienced different parts of the spectrum of misogyny than the norm. Even someone who has also moved between the same societies will have their own experience of it. Look for a group that wants to hear your experience whether they relate to the specifics or not. Thank you for sharing!
"I hope to hear more from different women from different backgrounds, so I would like to hear more of your struggles, there is nothing to be ashamed about it. To not feel alienated I'd go and buy feminist books from your home country if there are any. But in general as a POC italian woman, I remedy my alienation by participating in italian feminists spaces online, and following newspapers aligned with my political views, and participating in politics where I can, just feeling useful somewhat. Then since italian feminism or politics isn't very intersectional I go to YouTube to find POC that talk about their specific problems or deconstruct society as they see it."
Thank you for contributing to intersectional feminism!
"As a South Asian woman who moved to Europe, I can relate to how you feel. In my home country, I come across as 'ultra-modern', and in my country of residence, it took me two years to exactly grasp what 'subtle sexism' as opposed to 'overt sexism' looks like. I find it difficult to discuss my issues in the feminist groups I've been part of - their solutions would not touch on the nuances of culture that I experience. Online, Reddit as a whole is very US-centric. What has helped me was to join some women-centric groups from my home country - these are not naturally feminist groups, but they give a sense of relatedness. I also follow some accounts on IG from the expat communities. This helps me feel that I'm not alone in my struggles. I think you should still state your struggles - and open up the broader discussion that feminism and sexism are at different stages around the world. Happy to lend a listening ear anytime you want."
"I am in a similar situation except I have not been able to find a support group. My views are too ""radical"" for my home country and ""not relevant"" to my adoptive country. It's great to know you have found some relatedness. Where do you think would be the appropriate place for expats to express their feelings on feminism? I feel like I can only support local (i.e. of my adoptive country) feminism and not actively suggest things as I did not experience sexism in the same way as them."
"I think there are similar experiences that can be shared with local feminist groups as an expat. A common, unifying theme for me has been experiences in the workplace. Ive come to also realize, sadly, that I cannot expect all feminists to be intersectional. I had a wonderful feminist advisor (who I still respect) who recoiled when I started talking about racial microaggression. I very much wish I could discuss feminism with women from my own cultural background who are also expats. I have not cracked the code for this yet."
"I totally understand what you feel. But its also important to realise that intersectionality in feminism is so important. The fact that we mostly read and discuss Western feminism is a part of the post colonial discourse. There is a still a soft culture in academia about the Western understanding of feminism. And the fact that we often feel alienated from the discussions in our home as well as overseas is because we dont take multitudes of lived realities into account. Even if we do, we dont hear much about it and its often exoticized and seen as something bizarre in the West. Its so frustrating because women from third world countries are assumed to achieve the feminist discourse in the West. The cultural nuances are completely disregarded. The collective voices of women from the third world heard. There is need to engage with lived experiences of multitude of women from diverse cultures and classes. Patriarchy affects us all but it affects some more disproportionately than others. Feminism at the outset should account for this. So, we dont feel an outsider in a struggle that is for all the women around the world !"
"As a white intersectional feminist who has a number of PoC loved ones, some of whom are from colonised countries or simply countries with very different backgrounds, I recognise this isnt my place to respond to, but I hope I can welcome you (as a migrant, I know moving country and splitting your time between countries can be difficult in ways there arent words for; please know at least other ex-pats get it) and share some things Ive found helpful, for what theyre worth. I have found civil rights leaders from all sorts of movements but especially anti-racist and anti-colonialist movements super inspiring. Womanists, the largely black PoC women who led the intersectional movement, guided my growth and understanding of how to act right, and all errors I make are my own. I found treating the women that grew up rooted in sexism with respect paid dividends. Women have always found ways to live around sexism, whether they acknowledged it or not. Even the most hide-bound culture has ways for people to let off steam. It may not be worth preserving, necessarily, but it is worth understanding. You may find that you are the person best placed to write or speak about feminism in your home country, or intersectionality in your adopted country. But you dont have to do anything, and you are not alone, not ever. Even if there are few out and out feminists in your home country, there are surely more women who are sympathetic to it; native feminists in your adoptive country may not understand directly, but if theyre half decent and your friends theyll set themselves to understanding. Some groups I think you might have luck feeling at home with are 1) other women who have migrated from your home to your adopted country; 2) feminists from countries neighbouring or similar to your home country; 3) groups of immigrant feminists, without specific countries of origin, because some experiences are common. A very modern experience is trying to make friends with a number of different groups so as to satisfy the aches and needs that arise in us. Its a very lonely world (and perhaps foolish) but one hopes we can work on that, too."
US Marriage Rate Hits Record Lows.
"Article is behind paywall, but good. Let it burn. It's a vestigial social expectation that places undue pressure on couples to tie their entire financial and legal lives together.

"I agree. I'd also do away with common-law marriages. Let people live together while they can be happy and loving towards each other, with minimum hassle when it's over."
"Ironically, the link immediately underneath this on my front page was ""Divorce lawyers of Reddit, what is the most insane (evil, funny, dumb) way a spouse has tried to screw the other?"" on r/AskReddit. And I agree with you. Often when I see this brought up, it's in relation to hypergamy and women's expectations of a potential husband's earnings, usually stated as being unreasonable, even though we're talking about a population that wants to have a big ceremony that often costs more than my car."
"> even though we're talking about a population that wants to have a big ceremony that often costs more than my car. The ceremony/party is always seen as 'for her' 'her day' 'her being a princess' and when she's portrayed as marriage-crazy, its all about the ceremony-party having to be perfect (meaning to her precise micro-management preferences).

Who still get angry at the injustice and want to help the discussion by showing different perspectives to people who may not experience or see sexism themselves by feel like they just dont have it in them anymore?"
oh yea.
Yep. Im getting more and more jaded every damn day - particularly online. Discussing in person is usually better because people tend to engage in good faith.
"I think the worst thing is it's never just you answering the post question. I try to answer questions as best I can, but half the time there's someone who come along and replies to my comment clearly looking to pick holes just for the sake of an argument.

It's exhausting, I get scared every time I click send."

But every fucking time a feminist issue came up they were like climate change deniers: cherry picking evidence, claiming that vested interests (such as being female) meant we couldn't be objective, downplaying the seriousness of the issues. It would have been fascinating if it wasn't so exhausting to deal with."
"Yes, there's only so many times you can answer the exact same question coming from someone who actually doesn't care what you're saying and are just looking for an argument. It's tiring to try and answer thier questions and indulge them just be met with the exact same thing every time. I'm tired of it, especially when it doesn't come from a genuine place of wanting to learn, and unfortunately many posters aren't here to learn but rather to be antagonistic."
"Yes, and when that feeling gets really serious you might be suffering from/at risk of burn-out. It's important to balance activism with pleasure and renewal. You gotta have fun and learn to pick your battles-- this is a fight about endurance and stamina. We want you in it for the long haul-- so take a break, and know that you don't have to respond to every instance of ignorance or injustice that happens around you right as it happens-- it's impossible anyway."
Yes. It took me a while to realize that its not my responsibility to educate people. Doing so can be draining. We all have access to the same resources i.e. Google. You cant help people who cant help themselves.
"The one issue I struggle with most, both in this sub but especially outside of it, is the idea of reverse sexism or racism. I have felt the need, on several occasions, to explain that those are not real things, but outside of this sub, thats a great way to get downvoted into oblivion, which defeats the purpose of commenting if no one ends up seeing your comment. So when I see comments suggesting that reverse sexism is real and it has dozens of upvotes, I tend to just keep scrolling because I know theres little or nothing I can say to convince the majority-male forum that is reddit that it is untrue."
"OvercomplicateI feel like guys over complicate approaching a girl and getting her number. Just walk up, start a conversation, ask if shes down to hangout, then get her number. I tried this before learning PUA strategies and its worked, but combining that with the strategies can have better results though. Just dont over complicate it yall, its easy."
"That's the thing I don't know how to ""start a conversation"" if I see someone else doing it then maybe"
"In the past my successes have been ones where I don't think about it - I see a hot girl and just stop her or say something within a few seconds of seeing her. The ones where I see them, I think about what I'm going to say, and THEN go over - these didn't seem to go anywhere near as well. I overthink the interaction. It honestly within reason doesn't matter what you say as long as it's delivered with confidence. The beauty is, simply by approaching a random stranger you are displaying more confidence than 9 out of 10 guys who haven't got the balls to do it through fear of rejection. It immediately tells a girl 'this guy has extreme confidence'. But remember to remain 2 metres away and stay at home..."
"I noticed when I did this I went on more dates too. The choosing signals topic on YouTube has guys confused. A chick at this gym I workout at wasnt choosing at all, but when I approached her confidently she got wet as a dog. Dont take what these you tubers say seriously. Just approach with confidence, but also self improve daily. All yall dont have to be a bodybuilder to slay chicks, just dont be obese and youll be alright."
"Thats like telling someone who is afraid of heights dont over complicate things, just go sky diving or someone who is afraid of spiders dont over complicate, just go hold a spider. People are afraid of different things for whatever reason. Exposure is not the best way to get rid of fear. It in fact can make the fear worse should the experience be negative. If I held that spider to get over my fear, and it bit me or jumped on to my face, I would be even more afraid than before cause I would have verified my fear is rational. If someone who is afraid of women was told just do it with no social skills, they will have a bad experience and further push them away from approaching. Theres a process that needs to happen well before actually trying to overcome the fear. It may seem silly to you to be afraid of women, but it is a genuine fear a lot of men have and I dont think that telling them its irrational is the best way to go about it because they will not want to talk about their fear anymore and not seek help or guidance."
you cant be afraid of the person you want to fuck.
Why not?
Just curious... are you approaching people during the quarantine? Its weird seeing so many posts on this sub during the quarantine
Was thinking exactly the same. People posting as if we're not in the middle of a global pandemic and it's fine to just approach people in the street!
Like theres social distancing rules now in place yet dudes are talking about approach game haha
LA patron goes bezerk at someone recording her actions.
Stop recording me assaulting you!
"""I am a wOmAn!!!"""
I was just recording you for fun... But now it's evidence ROFL
"""he RAPED me!!!"""
from what i can see she looks like she can get a pass but seems like one of them tried it already and revoked her pass
Is this a How to be a Karen workshop training video?
"Have no doubt in my mind her friends describe her as someone who ""doesn't take shit from anyone"" and ""takes no prisoners"" and all those other quaint expressions."
And now it's on the web
"What should I do if a female friend says she's been told she's good at kissing?I had a female friend over my place sometime and while talking things and I asked what are you really good at? She responded saying ""she's told she's very good at kissing"". I said ""Do you want to try?"" with a cheeky grin?. She said ""you're still not there"". Did I do my best?"
"""Pfttt... I dont believe you, prove it."" With a smile and eye contact."
How can I bring up that topic again and say this? I don't want to come across as try-hard or needy
"You dont bring it up again at this point unfortunately.. Just relax around her, tease her like you would a little sister and most importantly have fun. Other opportunities will pop up, no single one-liner is going to change anything anyways."
"Ok. How can I make her chase me provided that she has mentioned several times that she was attracted to me at different times? It was a platonic conversation where she mentioned for example: ""other day I was dancing with you, I was so into you"" & ""I find it very interesting that you can be so calm and relaxed"" etc"
"I don't know that you can make her chase you per se.. you are the guy and as a result you will always have to make the first (and every) move. You just want to maintain your frame as a calm, confident guy and escalate physically from being platonic. More importantly, the time to act on things is when they feel right. The time for a funny comment about her kissing you, is in response to when she brings it up. The easiest time to escalate physically is if you're already dancing with her and physically close, etc. From the little I know about your situation, it's tough to say where you stand. But bottom line is that women like a witty, confident guy who doesnt seek their approval and presents as a challenge. Live your best life, study/work, lift weights, meditate, avoid porn, etc. Internalize the traits while improving your life with the above work ethic and you will be attractive to most women. With THIS girl specifically, if she's attracted you already, then you have to escalate your relationship from platonic to physical. If she is into you , but doesnt see you as a guy who has the balls to act on his desires... you will be permanently friendzoned. Hopefully that's not where you are. Regardless, just live your life, have fun, tease her when you can, and don't try too hard. Create sexual tension in situations where you can (look it up if you dont know what it means). Break the touch barrier with non-threatening touch; elbow, small of back, back of hand, etc. Keep strong eye contact if you dont already, and a hint of a smile is also a good bet. But most importantly, ACT when you have an opportunity; to tease her, to escalate physically, etc. Use the opportunities when she compliments you, to escalate and banter. E.g. If she says she was into you the other day or compliments your dancing, you can say something like ""I dont blame you.. I actually had to turn it down a notch, I didn't want you to lose control"". In other words, tease her when she compliments herself and agree with her in a cocky way when she compliments you. Use your own words and style, they matter way less than your actions, body language and ultimately your balls to act. Dont pass up good opportunities to act and escalate physically, sometimes they dont come again..."
"Thanks for that detailed response. Really appreciate. With this girl there's always sexual tension but I'm not looking for a relationship right now and she knows that. She doesn't want to be my fuck buddy (which I definitely like). There's always sexual tension between us. She puts her eyes down whenever I make a deep eye contact and touches her hair etc. I've complimented her a couple of times saying you've got a nice perky ass and jokingly spanked it. She laughed when I did it. I touch her at every opportunity like high-five, rubbing her shoulder to console her when I tease her etc but she never touches me back. We have very good flirtation with every opportunity. I just am scared to escalate and spoil it if she turns me down if I go in for a kiss. It'll just make me very low value cos I always tease her saying ""we never get along as a couple"" and trying or going for the kiss would not be congruent"
"She expected you to jump at the opportunity, and you did. You should've dropped her down a peg, as she did to you with ""You're still not there."" ""For the minor leagues..."" ""Some people set a low bar."" ""Being in the league doesn't mean you're an MVP candidate."""
"""Some people set a low bar."" I think this was a good response"
"I probably would've said something to neg her, like ""Right, you probably only kiss your mom all day."" And if she says shit like ""No, seriously, I'm good at kissing"", you go ahead expose her like ""Okay, why do you think I would want to know that?"" Shit tests: if you react or act on them, you've failed. You must find a way to pass them, either freeze her out (ignore her), or do something unexpected and reversed of what she expects from you to do. Some people love shit tests, because then they just know the girl is attracted to them but she wants to test your frame first, and your frame has to be firm. If you fail the shit test, you've shown lower value."
"GYNOCENTRISM: The dominant or exclusive focus on women in theory or practice; or to the advocacy of this - Society is women and children first. Its gynocentric, which is why high numbers of male politicians are of no use to men, as they do not campaign for mens interests at all"
vaginocentrism
women only or women mostly?
"Yeah thats what I think, Im thinking surely there is some funding. Although I wouldn't be surprised in Aus if there are 0 state funded male only DV shelters or services, maybe that is what is been referred to ... 0 male only funding. P.s. domestic violence in Aus and worldwide is dealt with wrong. It is a family issue with deep societal causes, drugs, alcohol, chlild abuse, dv as a child, dv parents etc. and needs to be treated as such. Feminist obsession with painting women as victims and only approaching VICTIMs i.e. after abuse has massively harmed society and women, and has done almost nothing to stop DV."
i absolutely agree
"For a second I was like ""Only 40 and 30? What..."" and then I realized that's for down under... lol Probably about right."
"Focusing only on deaths would, of course, skew the numbers. There are other effects, both physicial and psychological, that are ignored. Men die more from suicide but there is a difference in incidence of attempts (about 3-4x more likely in women than men), which can have varying short and long term effects. As for domestic violence, there should be parity of course, but again these data are limited for the same reason."
"&#x200B; >If women are committing suicide 4x the rate of men (I don't buy that, although I have seen some data to suggest that attempt it more often), have more depression and anxiety and all sorts of mental health issues, cant report abuse etc due to all sorts of mental and trauma blocks and stay with abusive partners.... why the hell are feminists saying toxic masculinity is the problem cause for male mental health issues or imply that men should be more like women, or women are wonderful and talk to each other and all that.... clearly the crisis is in women as you say yourself, as none of that female stuff they apparently do, and open up and talk, is helping them clearly is it? Women are killing themselve 4x as much according to you, and also being too indecisive to actually do it. You cant Balme toxic masculinity now all of a sudden, if it is female mental health care that is in crisis according to you! You see im not letting feminism have it both ways. And BTW the incidence of female suicide attempts is so high is one because of borderline personality disorder in women (they are not actually trying to kill themselves, although sometimes they accidentally do) and also basic stats that feminists often cant understand.... obviously if women aren't able to actually kill themselves the number of attempts per year (there's men and women, much more so women who attempt like 300x a year) will be high vs a man 1 attempt and he actually kills himself. if feminist bang on about men being responsible for violence, then sure, but that means on the whole they are responsible for inventing everything, discovering everything, exploring and pushing frontiers for humanity (oceans, space, new countries, continents, arctic, desserts etc), fine art, music, film, history, culture, billionaires, Nobel prize winners, billionaires and leaders... leaders even in female dominated industries and female activities such as fashion, shopping, makeup, cooking (so feminists can complain its because women are a minority, as men are a minority there and face social taboo in those fields but still end up on top) BTW sorry if this comes across as harsh, sarcastic etc, please understand I type very large amounts and quickly."
Men killing themselves more is used as proof masculinity is toxic. So does women attempting more mean that femininity is more toxic and incompetent?
"Exactly, what do we say feminists? Plus higher anxiety and depression rates? What double think are we going to use to explain this one?"

"Cried in my Zoom Class todayWhy do people have to be so cruel and nasty? I suffer the reverse halo-effect. People always assume that I'm retarded & think I'm weird/ annoying. I make people physically uncomfortable. My class had a debate on zoom today, and I struggled with public speaking (as usual). One girl had her microphone on & she laughed at me when I stuttered for a moment & forgot my argument. Everyone in my class thinks I'm massively retarded, and they will speak over me or completely ignore me. During the debate this one guy kept picking on me and being rude/ condescending. I noticed a stark difference in the way he spoke to me v.s the prettiest girls in class. It is pure suifuel, & makes me feel like complete shit Our professor asked us how the debate went at the end of class. This one girl from my group (who really dislikes me) openly stated that ""certain people"" in our group are ""incredibly frustrating"" and she ""couldn't stand"" listening to them. Those were her words, almost verbatim. Everyone just laughed...but it was clear she was talking about me. There are only THREE ppl in our group. I don't know why she had to be so nasty and passive aggressive. I am nothing but nice to her. I guess ugly people are garbage though & worthy of no respect I waited until the zoom session ended to speak with my teacher about my struggles with class participation/ public speaking. I immediately choked up and stated to cry before I could say 2 words. My teacher just sat there with this awkward smile on her face and asked if I wanted to ""come back in 2 minutes."" We then had this INCREDIBLY awkward conversation. It felt like I was holding her hostage lol. Even my own teacher thinks I'm a creepy weirdo. I explained my autism & struggles with social anxiety, and she suddenly started talking about how many students find the course material"" unfamiliar"" and ""intimidating."" She couldn't understand why I was upset..... You should have seen how uncomfortable she was lol. That was one of the most awkward moments of my life. She looked like she thought I was fake crying. I really wasn't though...I'm just that mentally unstable lol"
"I'm so sorry about that, no one should have to go through something like that. It's really hard to find genuine kind people these days. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always open to chat. : ("
people really get their dick hards over a couple laughs and validation from their peers huh. its so obnoxious.
"thats disgusting. being that openly cruel even during a global pandemic where millions are affected and suffering, youd really think that itd teach some people to learn some fucking empathy. Im so sorry sis"
It has been documented that there is a high comorbidity with autism and eating disorders due to the obsessive behaviour commonly displayed by those with ASD. I wouldn't doubt that there's also a high connection with BDD. A fixation on your flaws would certainly make you feel uglier then you really are
"My heart aches for you, sister. You are going to grow up so, so resilient in ways that these kids will not. It hurts and I know it's barely any comfort, but honestly, you are going to be /so/ prepared for the knock-backs in life. You're having to claw your way into recognition and being taken seriously - what happens to these pretty people when that starts to fade? One of the biggest lessons I've had to teach myself (more due to abusive father/controlling dynamics, but same theory applies) is to be warm-blooded, not cold-blooded. Cold-blooded people need constant validation from those around them - they seek it to warm themselves, they're always yearning for what others can give them. Warm-blooded people find validation and comfort within themselves, they understand their value and radiate with it, they don't need outside comforts or input. Focus on your own personal goals and you can still have a great life. I live alone in an apartment right next to work and it's a dream come true, I work in a field I'm passionate about and have so much spare time to pursue my hobbies. I'm taken seriously because I've had to force myself to be, and people know I definitely got where I am based on achievements."
"Usually I lurk, but I felt so bad for you since I resonate with so much. A lot of people think I'm slow because I say a lot of wrong answers out loud, and straight out ignore me in class or become downright nasty where they would talk about me negatively where I could hear them while in class. I feel like a total embarrassment to my whole major, or school because at this point I feel like everyone is smarter than. Are your lectures recorded? I would seek out the video if it is, and send it to the school/dean of your college to report bullying/cyberbullying. But I'm petty. Hopefully this is all over for you soon since summer is coming up soon. Keep your head it! If it gets worse, definitely report them/the class."
Your classmates are assholes.
"I'm sorry op. This all sounds horrible Your teacher sounds like a fucking imbecile I don't know if you're in college or high school but if I had kids laughing at other kids, I'd tell them I'd take points off their final papers and call it out, in front of the class, IMMEDIATELY Next OP - name the act you want the teacher to address Don't talk about social anxiety, don't talk about it like it's **your fault** You can tell us about specific things people did that were rude (they were - what little brats) - next time, tell your teacher Your teacher sounds like a fucking imbecile teaching a class of kindergartners. She's in the wrong for tolerating that stuff, not you"
Young girls can be so mean.. Sorry OP.

Sucks to be a human female:/ Even male animals aren't as picky as looks compared to male humans lol. the female animals dont have to wear makeup or show off. Male animals also are more beautiful than their female counterparts in other species too lol
">Male animals also are more beautiful than their female counterparts in other species too lol Exactly this! Just look at male peacocks, wild ducks, lions or pretty much the males of any other species. They look so much more flamboyant than their female counterparts, because that's how the genders in nature are supposed to be. Also male animals have the guts to take the first step and actually try to impress the female, *not* the other way around. Why did we have to be born as humans? LOL. Jokes aside, I've posted this picture because I think it's really wholesome, and I *do* believe that similarly nice and tolerant men exist. Not all men are shallow and resentful."

Most Democrats who are looking for a relationship would not consider dating a Trump voter
"Ok, so? What is there to debate?"
"Well, i more wanted to get people thoughts on it."
"I don't see this as gendered, or a good thing. At least not any better than: ""whites"" not considering dating ""blacks"" Or Christians not considering dating Jews Or MRAs not considering dating Feminists. Or any arbitrary group not considering dating other (related but opposed or different) arbitrary group. All of which could be re-phrased as ""bigots would not considering dating outside their own group""."
Comparing race to personal beliefs when it comes to personal choices in dating is just... not a good idea man.
"bigot bgt n. One who is strongly partial to one's own group, religion, race, or politics and is intolerant of those who differ. certainly seems appropriate"
Intolerance of another persons views is bigoted. Yes these sharp differences indicated the divided and bigoted nature of politics currently. The biggest bigoted group is also most likely to label the other group as bigots based on the data shown. Ironic.
"I think a better analogy would be non-racists not considering dating a racist. For a lot of those democrats that is probably a big part of why they wouldn't consider a Trump supporter. I'm not saying that all Trump supporters are racists, but a significant portion clearly are."
"I suppose that also explains the Republicans mentioned in the article as not considering Clinton supporters? or, as the article states: >The aversion to dating people of different political orientations reflects the partisan antipathy seen in the overall public."
I would disagree as you have a media amplifying it. Of course actually debating this is going to quickly go into politics. I think this says more about the marketing effectiveness and divided nature of the USA right now.

"Omega, beta, alpha. Just call it for what it is: Good-looking guys, average-looking guys and ugly guys. All this bullshit about 'game' is just cringe. In reality almost all couples are looksmatched. Therefore increasing your looks = getting better looking women."
Game doesn't work. couples are looks matched with the vast majority of women in relatjonships being unhappy because they aren't sexually attracted to their looksmatch
are we pretending social skills don't matter now? given we have two guys with equal looks the guy with better social skills is always gonna win being a shut-in introvert your entire childhood puts you at a massive disadvantage in dating
">are we pretending social skills don't matter now? They matter, but only a little. 80% looks 20% personality. >given we have two guys with equal looks the guy with better social skills is always gonna win Sure I agree with you. But most of the times people aren't equally good-looking in which case the better-looking guy is always going to win because personality won't compensate for looks. >being a shut-in introvert your entire childhood puts you at a massive disadvantage in dating How? 80% of rejections happen in the first 5 seconds of an interaction. You can immediately see the way a girl responds to you in the first few seconds if she's gonna let you flirt with her or not. If she doesn't like the way you look she's just gonna give you one-word replies, put on a bitch-face and have negative body language. Good luck flirting with that. Inb4 'you had the posture of a person that was a shut-in introvert 10 years ago so that's why she rejected you within 5 seconds'.

idk but how can i tell if am a normal dude or an omega I am kind of confused I am 5'5 which technically puts me in the Omega category cause it's not desired physically but at the same time I have been dating girls all the time and all of them were pretty much good looking so I don't really know were am i standing
Hafthor Bjornsson smashes world record deadlift 501kg
Im just happy I took a shower before noon today...thumbs up to Mr. Bjornsson.
Absolute beast
It almost looked as if he might be able to lift more?!? Thats just insane
I thought he was going to but I dont think he even made any attempts at a higher weight. Dude could have easily pulled 505.

Did you watch the lift?
Of course Hafthor Bjornsson smashed the record
"Getting rid of oneitis when abundance is momentarily impossible?I (18) have been putting my gf on a pedestal recently (double texting, interpreting her behaviour way too much, etc). She's starting to pull back, and I think she'll branch swing soon if I don't get my act together. I know, I know. Abundance - but that's currently not an option. Social distancing is heavily enforced in my country, clubs and gyms are closed, my school reopened but teachers are very strict about the rules. Tinder might even be counterproductive as meeting up is prohibited. So when abundance is impossible, what can I do to kill my oneitis? I don't want to break up either because in my current state of mind I'd probably feel very beat down about it, and I'll take my finals in two weeks, so that won't be good. Thanks in advance."
"Focus on the shit that youre doing: work/school, home workouts, running, learning a new skill, watching Netflix, playing scrabble with your family etc Create a busy schedule for yourself and use your phone less"
"Thanks, I'm trying to fill my days with as much stuff as possible. But as someone said a couple days ago under a post in the main sub, after being locked down for so long, you can't keep yourself busy the entire time. I'm currently revising all of my school books for the fourth time since the lockdown started, I've literally watched all the series and movies that interest me, my workouts take one hour if I drag it out, and after another hour of reading books I get tired of it. I was actually able to compensate this by playing ridiculous amounts of Call of Duty (I know it's unhealthy, but hey, at least I didn't catch oneitis during the first weeks of the lockdown due to it), but my PC broke down six days ago. School has restarted, but we have a shortened curriculum and are there for 4 hours max. Especially during weekends I don't know what to do"
"That's the thing, currently I have no possibility of meeting up with new girls. My country takes social distancing a tad bit too serious as far as I'm concerned, but hey, I don't wanna pay a fine up to $25k"
"I always tell young chaps to build the foundations of their life and not worry about girls. Get as much woman experience as you can but your time is 1000x better spent learning skills and building male networks.

"Thanks, I think you're right. I needed to hear that, I need to get back my view of the bigger picture"
"Also count yourself lucky player, half of asktrp have never had a girlfriend at age 28 ahaha \\\_()\_/"
"So you live with her? If not you can be more aloof/distant with your communication. Also use this time to get in shape and lift your SMV. If you dont live with her you can still pull back your attention. Be more hot and cold. For example be flirty, sexual and dominant; fuck her hard, and then go do your own thing (reading, tv, playstation.. whatever)."
"Nah, I don't live with her. We only see each other at school at the moment, and we make use of the short moments where there are no teachers around to yell at us to keep our 1.5m of distance. Removing attention, either via digital communication or spending free time at school with my mates instead of her could be good starting points, thank you"

"They have to be physically attracted to the person initially. Once they get to know each other, attractive exacerbates if the girl likes them. Also, I just agreed that looks aren't everything. I don't know why I got downvoted"
that is just incorrect. men and women and anyone in between are more than capable of developing feelings or becoming attracted to someone after time has passed
"Dude, that's not how we're biologically wired. It's just not. That's like being in the ""friendzone"" with a girl, staying, and hoping she'll fall in love with you. It's not gonna happen"
Downvoted for making women look slightly bad yikes
"Sometimes they do, but incels like to blame their jaw and hair line for not getting girls which is just ridiculous"
They dont have a personality to attract a girl anyways lmao
"Heh, yep"
Good strategy.
"I hope that when you declined her invitations, you gave legitimate reasons and offered to reschedule. Otherwise, many women would assume youre not interested and move on."
This sounds incredibly manipulative?
No its a roller coster with emotions. Manipulation is when u make someone do something for you
"You can manipulate someone into doing something for you but you can also manipulate their emotions into feeling a certain way - like the commenter said how one day you want her to feel angry and the next sad etc. I can see how this would keep things exciting or keep someone on their toes but I dont think its healthy to give someone the cold shoulder and to purposefully make them feel sad so they want you more. I support the notion that it can be good to have distance and separation in a relationship and that regular contact can lead to someone taking you for granted, but I dont agree with upsetting your partner on purpose for personal gain"
But this can be beneficial for the rs in a some way
"It's not, you just don't wanna constantly baby her. If you do she'll get bored real soon. If you treat her the same, she'll be the one manipulating you and then leaving you. It's not keant to hurt her, it's just a method of building attraction and interest."
"I completely agree that separation and unavailability can build attraction and interest, but I dont think it needs to be done via the method the original commenter mentioned. The method of purposefully making someone sad doesnt benefit the person thats being hurt, it only benefits the one doing the hurting and thats selfish It may not mean to hurt the person, but purposefully making someone else sad does hurt them and it taints their entire day You can still be a loving and supportive partner while being unavailable, you dont need to be cold or hurtful or closed off emotionally, and I dont agree that consistently showing someone you care about them is babying them, I think its the foundation to a secure and healthy relationship. Would you want to be with someone that is overly affectionate and loving one day and the next it seems like they dont give a toss about you? It may make you want to be closer to your partner, but is that healthy?"
"A lesson I learned from a stranger on the busThis past winter, I was riding the bus consistently to a new job in a new city. I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. This woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. But this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. Then, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well, despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner. And as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. Whether you cover your face or not, smile more. Smile for yourself, smile with your eyes. It will change your life, it might change someone else's. It is feminine, it is gentle, it is kind. It seems we need more of that these days than ever."
:) That is a lovely reminder.
"This is beautiful! In my mind your story played out like a movie and the ladys face was a monk/nun named Pema Chodron, who I adore. That lady got on that bus everyday as your teacher, and you were an excellent student!"
my wife did this when she was 17 when she entered the classroom. oh my god it got my attention. told her i was attracted to her. the rest is history - still happily with her now 27 years later.
"Remember this lesson for the rest of your life. You can control how to feel and how you emotionally respond to things even while you can't always control what happens in your life. **No one else can make you feel bad, you have to let them.** Too often I hear from friends and acquaintances that their partner doesn't make them happy. That's not their job, that's yours and you can control how you feel. Congrats on this btw. I honestly think most people never figure this out - they let others or circumstances dictate how they feel."
I love this.
This is the first advice in How to Win Friends and Influence People. A must read for everyone.
"That is really lovely. I find myself forcing a ""resting bitch face"" because honestly, I got tired of people taking my nice-ness and manners for an invitation to flirt or straight up say something harassing. I wish it didn't have to be that way."
This is such a great and beautiful post. Thank you for sharing!
"Where I live, no one smiles for no reason and no one greets strangers, so I feel very self conscious smiling when there is no reason to. It feels very intentional and unnatural and I also don't think I have the facial muscles to smile for long periods of time. How do I get over this?"
"When Abundance Mentality isn't enough to fight Oneitis?Even if I'm talking to or dating multiple girls, and I have the options that I need for this ""abundance mentality"" concept, there is *always* that one girl that I just meld with more than the others; perhaps even more than with any of my past partners too. The oxytocin, dopamine, and whatever crazy chemical shit that goes on up in my neurons hits me like a tornado after two or three hookups with this person. I tell myself to snap out of it. ""Abundance mentality, man! You're going on dates with different women each week, you're texting dozens at the same time, pull your shit together!"" But my mind wanders off. I lose motivation to pursue those other prospects available to me. I feel physically odd; those familiar ropes of infatuation and attachment tying themselves into a knot deep in my core. I try to distract myself with work, hobbies, and exercise. But those are only distractions, and the thoughts and knots come back any time I'm idle. How the fuck do you deal with it when ""abundance mentality"" isn't working?"
"I kind of am in the same situation, and lose interest in pursuing other girls since most things are great with one particular girl. I wonder if some people are just not made to fuck all the women available to them. Not a bad thing imo"
"When you know exactly what kind of person you want/need I can see it being a good thing. But for me, I feel like I still don't know specifically what I want/need, and I tend to get blinded by all the sparks at first."
"Are you hooking up with that girl? Then you're in love. Oneitis happens when you don't get the girl and get obsessed with her because you don't have her. Seduction is not about having 100 girls at once, it's about being happy and the only person who can decide what makes you happy, is you. Just enjoy the ride"
">Are you hooking up with that girl? Yes. >Then you're in love. No. Love doesn't happen that quickly. And for those who feel it does, I question their mental stability. >Oneitis happens when you don't get the girl and get obsessed with her because you don't have her. Which in this case could be the potential of not ""having"" her because there's no commitment. Which is a strange bit of cognitive dissonance as I have no goals of marriage. Having an exclusive partner/companion, yeah, but not any legal contractual bullshit. Or perhaps I'm misinterpereting the way she is around me and she's like that around all the guys she hooks up with. Or perhaps it's the fear of losing that connection and chemistry."
"Youre fighting yourself. Some people are more compatible with each other than others. Thats a good thing. Dont pour your heart out to her, but dont hide your feelings. Theres nothing wrong with only talking to one girl as long as you preoccupy yourself and stay busy."
This answer from a previous question asked applies here. https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g7epl9/if_you_improve_youself_so_much_why_would_you_need/fogzidg/
">If you want sex, you have sex, and if you find someone who absolutely thrills you, then you get into a relationship. And, it's usually a pretty solid one, because it's based out of genuine respect instead of need. That's basically my life philosophy at the moment, but it starts to crumble at the ""If you want sex, you have sex"" part because, as a guy who can't just sit and wait looking pretty at the bar, it is damn hard to find a partner whenever you want. That plus the lack of trust in the self to accurately assess if that person *truly* thrills you plays a part in this, I think...."
Having good chemistry with one specific person isn't one-itis. One-itis is the inability to move on from a single person when they aren't reciprocating.
That's a great point that needs to be reiterated in the seduction community

I've even corrected people on its usage, guys arent simps just because you don't like them or because they believe something you don't. It's being thrown around like the -isms are by sjws, feminists, and cultural marxists. It's going to be turned into another word tossed around to invalidate someone's arguments and logic, like incel, bigot, racist, etc. Which is a bad thing. If there's no line to define what a word means, but severe amounts of negativity are associated with it, it'll become nothing more than something to spew out when weak people can't win an argument."

Edit2: u/Alecmaiz0 Explained it pretty well."
Its behind a paywall for me but assuming these men are not being vilified but in fact praised for their actions and contribution?
I think hes just stating that the positive actions and achievements of men are never gendered or reported as a positive example of masculinity compared to the negative always being gendered and accentuated as part of masculinity in the media.

Never realised just how blackpilled the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series were when I was younger. Flipping through some pages to relive nostalgia and they hit me with this.
"Lmao it's funny because the main character,Greg Heffley has a very incely personality. I loved these books as a kid,still do."
Aw poor Eugene :(
then he gets plastic surgery and it turns out being ugly is in style
Hopefully this belongs here. How can she slap?
Look at all those yellow knights.
"I don't know what disgusts me more. The fact that they ignore that she slapped him first, or the other guys' saying that they should assault his family. Like how can you advocate for that woman who hit him AND demand that this guy's family be punished for nothing they did? Total hypocrisy. And for the record, if a woman were to slap me, no I would not slap her back partly because of the insane double standard about women who are violent to men (and because I'm not a violent person in general)."
Afterwards they stripped the guy naked and held him down while a pitbull ate his gentials. NSFL video if you google it.
"this is absolutely disgusting. how can they ingore the fact that she slapped him first and even when he points it out simply sidestep the issue? even more stupid is that they called him a coward for doing probably the bravest thing someone can do in that situation - attempt to break a stupid fucking double standard that is looked down upon by all these yellow pieces of shit. what disgusts me even further is that they're saying ""fuck your sister, fuck your mum"" when they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. they're advocating for assault in three ways; they're advocating for the woman who hit him, they're telling each other to hit him when he did nothing to these yellow knights, and they're telling each other to assault his family. this is honestly the most disgusting way i've ever seen the pussy pass applied, ever. fuck everyone involved, except the one person that tried to stand up to this dumb fucking double standard that has been created by radical feminists."
"Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiimps LIKE HONESTLY, THEY JUST SIDESTEPPED AROUND THE FACT THAT SHE SLAPPED HIM FIRST, AND WHEN HE SAID IT, THEY DIDNT LISTEN. WHAT THE FUCK IS HUMANITY"

What's the purpose of this thread? It's so obvious and has been said like a million times already.
I mean women only care having sex with 20% of men so they do care less about sex :P
You don't even need to go that extreme. There would just be a lot more male prostitutes if the demand for Chads was anywhere as close to the demand men have for women.
No we don't. I would be happy without ever having sex again in my life. I've had attractive popular guys who were out of my league try to initiate something with me and I backed off immediately because I wasn't interested. How many men would refuse an attractive woman who was coming onto him? My guess is zero.
Does the patriarchy and toxic masculinity cause men to experience loneliness at higher rates and more severity? Has this lead to the rise of incel movements?Incel is slang for Involuntarily Celibate.
"I don't think, that incels are more lonely than anyone else. The difference is, that they have a scapegoat for it."
"Yes. Maybe, and men only have themselves to blame. To answer your first question, research in the US shows older widows return from grief more easily than widowers, because women are more likely to hold the burden of keeping social networks alive. ([Source 1](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/56/1/S56/546685) [Source 2](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=widower+loneliness&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBPk5Uv_P2e4J)). When their husbands pass, theyre far more likely to have their network to lean on and come comfort them. What do you think happens to the husbands whose wives arranged their social calendar for the last 30 years? Toxic masculinity dissuades boys from working with their friends to process emotions. Whereas women and girls *define* friendships by how vulnerable they can be with each other. So, men grow up thinking a romantic relationship is the space where you can be open about your emotions. Oftentimes they dump all their lives emotional baggage on their partner, which is bad for the female partner who expects to *share* this work. But worse, how many years can a man go without that space where he can process how hes dealing with life stress? If a man never learns the tools to process everyday emotions, and never had a friendship where they felt open doing so, I have no doubt they can turn bitter and violently lash out at women."

"What? Who does something because they *don't* enjoy doing it? Not the OP, but I'd say they do it because they are expected to which has nothing to do with enjoyment or lacktherof. That's what makes it burdensome. It's a job that falls on women in cishet relationships whether they ask for it or not. Also, considering women are individuals, it's very likely that the work of keeping up social connections for 2 people is burdensome to a few and difficult even for the ones who enjoy it."
"Shes referring to emotional labor, which is a burden. Generally, women are tasked with remembering birthdays / gift giving, catering to loved-ones, listening to partners woes (emotional support), setting up play dates, going to school functions, or dinner parties etc. All this requires maintenance of their social network, which is work."
[deleted]
"It's not that it makes them more lonely, it's that it the affects of the patriarchy on men is different and manifests differently between men and women. All people suffer from alienation and loneliness. It's just that mens form makes them more likely to (wrongly) consider feminism as an enemy rather than a solution, and to ignore things that can actually help them (like self reflection in order to counter toxic masculinity). It's also that there haven't been many male-liberation movements that have been openly feminist, most have been about reinforcing the patriarchy on themselves further. It's also that most male-led feminist movements have been very openly radical, openly marxist feminist, meaning men have further considered them as enemy rather than a solution to the problems of patriarchy"

"The Second Arrow Currently there's an interesting AMA featuring Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the happiness lab. One of her replies contained an old parable I'd learned years ago but had forgotten till I read that thread. For those that struggle with self confidence; insecurities and negative self talk; this was her reply; *Thats a hard one, as I incorporate a lot of the tips I share with my students from meditation to exercise to trying to protect my time affluence.* *But if I had to pick one, Id say the most important insight comes from the fact that that we can control our reactions to the bad situations in life. Its an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this Buddha asks his followers if its bad to get hit with an arrow when youre walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if its worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control thats all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.* *And so Id say the biggest insight thats had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow.* - Dr Laurie Santos During my teens I grew up with fairly high expectations. At the time I was expected to work, excel at studies and then contribute wherever else I was required. It's a gruelling weight to bear when there's so much expectation. I was drinking with my uncles and cousins one time and after relaying my woes; one uncle told me not keep shooting myself with *the second arrow*. He then told that same story. At the time I had a deep seeded doubt that the path I was forced upon; I wasn't up to. Insecurities, self doubt and my negative internal dialogue were eroding my confidence. Gaining that perspective however, then applying it; changed my world view. It irrevocably changed my frame. We all face adversity. Frame; and the base of its strength comes from a choice. We don't have a choice getting shot with the first arrow; **but we CAN consciously chose not to shoot ourselves with the second arrow.** *Godspeed and good luck!*"

It is honestly better to try and fix your bad situation rather than moan on and on about it. You get nothing out of bitching about your problems excessively.
a good reminder. the two arrow thing doesn't strike me a particularly good representation of the idea though.
Another way to put it is: worrying simply doubles the amount of adversity you go through. Once when it actually happens and once when you worry. The act of worrying and your reactions to adversity is what determines whether or not youll be hit by the second arrow.
This is actually awsome. Im suprised it doesnt have as much likes as it should.

"[Censorship]/[Opinion] Robert DesJarlait: ""My Native American father drew the Land OLakes maiden. She was never a stereotype."""
"This opinion piece was published on *WaPo* and penned by the son of the artist behind the Land O'Lakes maiden. And what he describes is all too recognizable: >North Dakota state Rep. Ruth Buffalo (D), for instance, [told](https://archive.li/o/0RdcR/https://www.twincities.com/2020/04/15/land-olakes-makes-over-packaging-does-away-with-indian-maiden-logo/) the Pioneer Press in St. Paul, Minn., that the Land OLakes image of Mia went hand-in-hand with human and sex trafficking of our women and girls by depicting Native women as sex objects. Others similarly welcomed the companys removal of the butter maiden as long overdue. > >How did Mia go from being a demur Native American woman on a lakeshore to a sex object tied to the trafficking of native women? While the author, by his own admission, ""participated in protests against mascots and logos using American Indian images in the early 1990s, including outside the Metrodome in Minneapolis when Washingtons team played the Buffalo Bills in the 1992 Super Bowl"" he realized just how hypocritical the censorship being pushed is. >Mias vanishing has prompted a social media meme: They Got Rid of The Indian and Kept the Land. That isnt too far from the truth. Mia, the stereotype that wasnt, leaves behind a landscape voided of identity and history. For those of us who are American Indian, its a history that is all too familiar."
"Ah yes, haven't we all jacked it to the Land O' Lakes woman dozens of times?"
"The funny thing is, the rationale being given by those who had her dropped speaks more about how *they* view Native Americans than anything else."
"The funny thing for me is, he isn't remotely conflicted about his previous stance on ""The Washington Team"". Except their logo has a very similar story behind it as the one his father worked on. He says in the article that he isn't just defending the Land O'Lakes Maiden because of the connection to his fathers work, but with even a *tiny* bit of reading between the lines, it's clear that's *exactly* what's happening here."
I got the sense that he's found out the hard way what happens when the censorship being pushed (including the kind of activism the author did back in the day) is used far closer to home. It gets harder to justify that kind of BS when it directly involves something one is more familiar with.
"That's a more charitable reading than mine, I don't get the idea that he's conflicted at all, the whole article seems dedicated to explaining why *it's different in this case, because ~~it's my dad's work~~ reasons.* If he meant to recant his previous opposition things like this, or to indulge in any self reflection, it didn't come across to me at all. It's an interesting article either way, though."
"At minimum, it speaks more about the hypocrisy of the people censoring the work, ostensibly in the name of Native Americans. And by most accounts, many Native Americans seem to be getting peeved with activists and ideologues speaking ""for"" them."
Very interesting! Good find.
Thanks! It's really telling how you have activists claiming to be defending the rights of Native Americans...by erasing their contributions to American art.
"She saw out of the corner of her eye a dude dancing snd thought she was being harrassed or something and attacked that soy boy that didn't defend himself, she even threatened him, nobody batted an eye and she felt empowered for sure."
Id punch him too for doing those horrible dance moves.
what an absolute loser resorting to violence immediately
"It wasn't just dancing, it looked like he was air humping her. She probably wouldn't have done it if she knew it was a stupid dance move, but frankly, she should have done it anyway, anyone comporting themselves like this in public deserves a good smack."
"You obviously don't know shit about the way people dance now, you should be smacked just for making a stupid ass comment"

She was a light skinned black that the majority love. I've noticed that many women in my family rope. My aunt took her life at 40 and she was never married and she never had a husband. My other cousins daughter downed a bunch of pills at 30. No suicide note, but I never saw her with anyone either. People in my family need to stop breeding. Their shit genes ruin lives."
I think you just have a gene that makes people think suicide is the only way because three deaths ? Wow
"This is heart breaking, what a cruel world we live in."
"I'm sorry for all your losses, please dont rope."
Sounds like sensitivity to depression might run in your family
That's what I was thinking. My aunt has had a few suicide attempts
"Its a very real and serious thing that affects you on a neurological level, Im not an expert but a real expert could definitely help you if you have a dopamine deficiency. If you are in the position where you can get help Id definitely look into it, it can take a lot of effort but if solved it would definitely be worth it! You deserve to live a happy and healthy life."
"Mental illness is a terrible, horrible thing. I am so sorry for your losses. Please dont resort to this if you start to feel bad again. You have an online community of women of all ages here for you, and my inbox is always open. Feel better soon op"
Thank you for your kind words :)
"If many people in your family committed suicide, it's very likely that there's an underlying mental issue. Some mental issue can also passed on by genetics. You should check it out."
How GOOD were Robert Greene books actually?
not really. can attest they were for introverted love unrequited nerds
"I do agree, that for introvert people, Greene is a good choice"
"I've got mixed feelings. I've read a couple, and always find them pretty meh. That said, my favorite quote comes from 50th Law, but it's 50 cent's words, not his. ""Your task is to resist the temptation to wish it were all different; instead you must fearlessly accept these circumstances, even embrace them. \[...} The firmer your grasp on reality, the more power you will have to alter it for your purposes."""
"wow, thanks for sharing"
48 Laws of Power had some golden nuggets but some laws seemed very narcissistic
"the whole point of the book was to be read in the absence of morality as historical examples on how to attain power. Ofc some of the laws are narcissistic, others are downright immoral lol"
That's literally the point... haha
"I greatly enjoyed the historical examples from his books. If youre looking for a book to follow religiously then yeah, his are probably problematic. If youre looking for well fleshed out points with historical examples then they are great. I like history tho so I am biased"
Awareness of the laws is key NOT actually using them to your benefit. The historical examples were very insightful and generally from less well known episodes of history.
Too much equality
Yes they should be conscripted. Make an all female battalion and put them up the front. Let them experience their own Normandy landings and Pacific theatre. Then they can moan about shit.
Yes Sir
"Feminists: We want equality! No, wait. Not that kind of equality"
Never should have let the join if they can't pass the same tests as men without lowering standards...
Because lowering standards means you're risking the lives of other troops around you..
"Let this marinate, you have a demographic that can vote for war, but absolved from ever having to serve in it. Oh and did I forget to mention, that demographic is ""oppressed""."
"I honestly don't know - are women allowed on 'the front lines' alongside men right now? Say there is another Vietnam where troops are deployed into the jungle for a couple of days at a time. Are men and women sent in there together into 'the shit'? Are they expected to hike for days with a full pack, carry wounded soldiers, brawl with the enemy by hand if need be?"
Yes
"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 05, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger. Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha. Gentlemen, Own Your Shit."

Measurement: post cropped before and after pics as evidence.

I'm eating healthy and 1000+ below my TDEE, OMAD except one or two days a week after morning workouts, protein is staying up at 1-1.5g/lb body weight per day, but my body seems to have decided that it wants to stick at 192lbs. I've lost 15lbs in the last 6 weeks but I've got another 12lbs to go to hit sub 12% BF and 7lbs to hit a true sub 15%. I'm about to go back into full Keto OMAD as I'm frustrated with the stall, I'm basically looking for some advice from guys who have done quick cuts like this 60 day one I'm doing now. Do I just soldier through with the low calorie count? My primary concern is to finish dropping this fucking fat and meet my BF% goal. If I lose a little muscle as well, fuck it, I can build it back better later from sub 12%. Thanks for the help bros ###Financial I will find and buy a nice pair of shoes. ###Professional ""I will update my resume with my new experience in preparation for promotion opportunities."" I've put together a list of what I've accomplished of significance over the last 3 months to be refined into my resume. 7 things that those responsible for selecting the promotion would appreciate in a candidate. ###Social I got halfway through writing out a mini FR for each date, and then realized the dates themselves don't matter. The girls don't matter. What does is what I learned about myself from them. I learned that me being ""me with MRP"" works just fine, most women eat that shit up, and those who don't seem to be unbalanced in some way, or else I showed too much weakness and they smelled it. I learned that I can more and more frequently think fast enough to frame myself positively while in the flow of conversation without lying, and if I can't I can change the subject, STFU, or AA AM PF. I'm learning that most of that I do automatically, its not a ""thinking it through"" kind of thing. You either do it or you don't. It's got to be natural, not forced. If it isn't, STFU. I still talk way, way too much. I default to comfort/Beta behaviors so I have to constantly keep my focus on creating DHV/Alpha display opportunities and on that mindset, because the Beta comes through on its own. I also am successfully eliminating many low value Beta behaviors and sticking to more ""oakish"" and higher value ones. My attitude with these girls now is basically ""I'm interested in learning a bit about you to see if I think there's the possibility for more, but IDGAF if you reciprocate, and if you misbehave, bye because I've got better shit than this to be doing, this is for fun *for me*, and there's literally girls who wish they were out with me/talking/chatting tonight instead of you"" (this is not something that's spoken, its just my attitude. I'm not rude but I'm pretty clear about covertly signaling that they have stiff competition and about not caring if they like my personality or not) ###Mental MRP fixes the man, and I've decided that I am a man worth the effort to fix. Even with how little work I've done so far, I have value. I am my prize no matter what anyone else thinks about how I'm living my life or the choices I make. Fuck who I let myself become with my ex, that guy was a butthurt dick who blamed everyone else for how his life was turning out. I'm better than that. The past is a lesson that doesn't define who I am or will become. *But* - that guy doesn't ever disappear. He's always there, waiting for me to get tired or lazy, so he can take over again. He mocks me with catcalls of ""its so nice to just relax and not be so *busy* all the time "" ""this soda is delicious, especially when paired with these French fries "" ""this videogame/movie is awesome! So glad I decided to spend hours of my life on this "" He is constantly testing my resolve. There is a ton of work to do. I have drive and high standards for myself, but like everyone else I avoid the hardest internal work and seem to be at my best when focused on one or two areas at a time. For the last 3 months that focus has been work and has now shifted to work and plating. I've been attempting to establish my career and my ""single life"" at the expense of my most critical internal work and my children. The first is not such a bad thing, a short term push for long term gains, the second I still feel has been necessary to figure out what I need to be focused on internally, I get constant data about my mental state from how I react to women. I've also needed the external motivation in my current frame-less faggot mode of being... That being said there hasn't been any wasted effort, just lessons, and groundwork laid for next steps in my journey. ###Marriage I've been making STBX calm down 3yo before bringing her to me for bed on my nights if 3yo isn't already with me as I wind down, because STBX lets 3yo stay up while she plays video games on STBX's nights, despite me telling her she needs to give 3yo a reasonable bed time. I'm not dealing with the fall out of her poor choices, she can fix it herself and give me a reasonably behaving child, not a tantrum throwing mess getting dumped in my lap at 9pm when I'm going to bed so she can go visit Chad. ###Family Playing with 3yo more regularly, engaging her and being present. 14yo I am playing a long game, most times when I get home she is playing online with friends. I offer to do things she likes, so far only once has she taken me up on the offer, but I'lltake it, and we both had fun. I'll seek to build on that experience. I also drag her outside on weekends, even if just for lunch in the backyard with my parents and a bit of play with her sister on the swing set. She ""hates it"" but has fun once forced away from the screens inside the house with a moment to adjust her attitude. ###Goals Don't let on that I know about STBX indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (16 week streak) Plating OPSEC (4 week streak) Go to at least one Social activity without family. (5 week streak) Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (11 week streak)"

Currently reading: TRP PDF. &#x200B; \#Stats: Weight: 186LB from 215LB. 5""10 Bench: 315, Squat 285, Deadlift 375 &#x200B; Health: Looking pretty good, I have amazing results everywhere, I just need the 6pack. I figure if I drop to 175 and hold that for a few months the 6pack will show. Then I can bulk back up to 190-ish (slowly). &#x200B; My energy is through the roof, confidence is out of control (it always has been). &#x200B; &#x200B; \#Work Doing pretty amazing, but COVID needs to hurry otherwise they will lay off more people. I lost two employees last week. &#x200B; &#x200B; \#Family Kids are great, I'm around them all the time, we'be bonded so much lately. &#x200B; &#x200B; \#Wife: Horrible failed shittests a few times this week. I blew up about her having too much control, or trying to have the final say on anything related to the kids. I pushed back, hard, told her the kids are 50/50 and that she no longer gets the final say. That if she thinks that she's the only one who decides what they can and cannot do... then court will give me 50% by law. I blew up way to fast, said some mean things, lost my frame. --- We had some great sex about an hour later though. &#x200B; Additionally, I failed another test, I bitched about her having zero effection, and she needs to change. Suprisingly... she has alot. She's putting in effort now. &#x200B; \#Leadership: I have my wife and sisters on a health kick. Most started Keto and are working out daily now for an hour. My wife has like 8LBS so far. My sisters have lost about 4LB. &#x200B; &#x200B; \#Fun I was swimming and someone posted a photo on social media with me and the kids... I had a fuck ton of suprise likes and people shocked at my body transformation, lol. I have a few friends PM me asking what the fuck I'm taking. --- Been working out for over a year now. &#x200B; &#x200B; \#Goals I have a new goal, I am going to start a fucking business.

"**OYS 19**: Mid 30s, 6 190lb, \~13%BF (Navy method), Separated, one kid 3yrs (f) **Week Goals** * One meditation session 20min 4 * 10 min meditation 7/7 * Boundaries 9/10 * Mobility 100% of intended sessions * No porn for four weeks two week done **Reading:** NMMNG, MMSLP, Pook, MAP, Side Bar, Unchained male, models, The Eagle and the Dragon, WOTSM, WISNIFG, The dating playbook for men, The subtle art of not giving a fuck, The Rational Male, Awareness, Meditation Book (40%), NMMNG (40%), Stop walking on eggshells (50%). Sidebar. **Mission:** Win each day. **Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.* * Cardio times three (Hill sprints, run, metcon) these are for mental health more than anything. * Weights three sessions * I go in energy cycles, for a few days Ill need less sleep, be more awake and I think have orgasms that dont feel as good, then Ill be more tired, sleep more, and my orgasms feel betternot sure what the fuck that means. **Separation:** Ex is using daughter as bargaining chip. The mediation process has been surprisingly unbiased after I got rid of the first mediator. I have only done the intake session and Im sure they try and make you feel heard so Ill wait until we actually sit down to make a call. Im doing what needs to be done. If we go to court, I am ready but I suspect this is stressing me out more than I realize (see mood in mental). *Guilt*: this is still a major problem for me. My ex has stopped my overnights for no reason and I still feel guilty only paying the mandated child support. Even the mediator asked if I had considered only paying what Im legally required to pay. There are benefits to paying more, but I can't separate how much is guilt and how much is the benefits. **Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.* I am trying to focus on just doing what I want. Not putting it through any filters (society or MRP) just what I want. I still need to be very careful with all the covert contracts etc but Im trying to act more authentically and noticing when the shit comes up so I can more quickly move into that space. *Mood*: Lower than it has been over the past few weeks. I still have periods of joy but mostly when with my daughter. Feeling more emotional I feel like crying for no reason, watched something sad in a movie, felt like crying... Still mood is better than before the T-Cream. I have been deliberately digging into painful memories/thought patterns and maybe that plus the worry about the STI and ex being a shit with court is wearing on me. Im not entirely sure. When feeling flat Im focusing on letting go of shoulds e.g. I should be driven and crushing life and instead just taking the next manageable step. This is helping keep me more productive on these days. E.g. one day I was feeling a bit lazy and annoyed at myself, I should be driven and motivated at all times. But thats bullshit and just uses mental energy on negative thought loops, instead I checked off the productive things I had already done; work, got blood taken, ate healthy and then I went and meditated for 20min and did hill sprints. Consistent forward progress. I will apply my mental energy to this rather than chastising myself for failing. *Anger*: I have a lot of it, Im pissed at what happened to my dad, pissed at what happened to me and pissed at my ex. I am struggling to manage my anger at my ex. She is driving us towards court for ridiculous reasons and wont get what she wants out of it. I am praying in the iron temple and upping the cardio, channeling my anger there is helping. Also, Im trying to change the narrative, when I find myself running a skit in my head I replace it with, you have all the big wins already and you are just going to keep building a great life. What do you want right now? *Needs*: something that resonated from NMMNG was having needs means being needy and needy represents a one-way ticket to abandonment. I am really starting to see how having emotions was met by a parent shutting down and how this is driving a lot of my current dysfunctional relationship patterns. *Caretaking*: this runs so deep, I see myself as the protector from life. I dont know what I have to offer apart from this. I feel like women wouldnt want me unless I provide this. Interestingly the thing thats helping the most is time alone in nature, I feel my life energy I just exist and thats when I feel most whole. Women can want this or not its up to them. But on some level I know its more attractive. Still, new mental models take a while to embed and this is a deep one for me. *Goals*: last week u/[Blarg\_Risen](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blarg_Risen) pointed out I need goals. I still need to do some work in this space but I wrote down my values/who I want to be, my 3 month objectives and longer term goals. I read this regularly and am finding it is helping me stay focused. **Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.* I am present and calm with daughter, I enforce boundaries but give her as much space to experiment with life as I can. Im happy with this area. Current focus areas are: be present, calm, clear boundaries, enabling independent play and not letting my stress with ex leak over into our interactions."
"**Validation + (BF#8):** I made a blank profile on seeking arrangements basically its young hot (although some are neither) women looking for guys and ranges from looking for a weekly allowance to have your shit together. Either way, I was not looking seriously, didnt message anybody etc but thought if I do want to fuck a hot 19year old this might be an easy way and it was part of the validation experiment. I found myself falling much more into the validation or insecurity trap than I had with tinder. I was thinking things like; Im not successful/good enough for her, I dont have anything to offer and was thinking how I could position myself to be more what they wanted. Im not sure what the difference is with this or tinder. Im not sure if its validation or insecurity that driving this thinking. Not in a I want x outcome and therefore should do Y but really I dont give a shit about what anybody thinks, I did give a shit what they think. I clearly do not think Im the prize and still want women to want me. **Breaking Free Activity 15:** Identify emotional pukes. * Withdraw/sulk * Threaten to leave when I dont want to * Get angry with them * Escape fantasys * Ruminate and talk about what a shitty person they are * Get sad/down **Breaking Free Activity 16:** Put yourself first Hard in the circumstances, however I have noticed I consider other people a lot, especially ex in the mediation negotiations. I am just noticing these feelings and what comes up around it. I am trying to do a few more things just because I want to and again, noticing the feelings. **Breaking Free Activity 17:** Examples of how you used coping mechanisms in childhood/adult life for a smooth and problem free life. I didnt want to do this one but Im very glad I did. * Doing it right: In childhood I wasnt naughty I would follow the rules and do what was expected of me. As an adult I have to get things right, I have to do each part of my life correctly. * Playing it safe: As above for childhood. As an adult I dont do some of the things I want to do e.g. start a business/NGO, I take the safe and easy path e.g. current career. * Anticipating and fixing: as a child I would anticipate what would make teachers happy and do what they wanted rather than what I wanted to do. As an adult, in relationships, I anticipate what they might want and try and fix their problems for them. I feel responsible for other peoples happiness. * Trying not to rock the boat: as a child I was meek and quiet, I tried to please others, I never wanted attention on me. As an adults Ill often smooth things over with people particularly in relationships. I want to call someone on their bullshit but I dont to avoid causing problems. * Being charming and helpful: childhood Im not sure if I used this one. Probably the helpful, as an adult fuck I love being helpful. * Never a moments problem: childhood basically the same as many of the others. As an adult, I try not to have any needs to avoid causing any problems, anything you want. I remember the first thing I did when I started lurking (fuck I should have just started OYS) was start to have an opinion, yes actually I do want the steak over the chicken for dinner. * Using covert contracts: childhood, not entirely sure, I think I used the if Im good, Ill get love and affection reasoning and wont feel abandoned. As an adult I use them all the time, if Im the perfect partner Ill get the love, affection and sex I want. I use them a lot, I try to be something of value to other people and in exchange Ill get their friendship or whatever. Im trying to just be more authentically me, and great if they like it but its ok if they dont too except that secretly its not ok they dont like it, I want them all to like me. * Controlling and manipulating: as a child I have vague memories of needing something to be sad about, I couldnt just be sad and ask for affection, I needed a reason. Not sure if that really goes in this category, as an adult I fill the same way. I need to have a reason for wanting or feeling anything. * Caretakeing and pleasing: childhood, if I pleased my parents I get love. As an adult, if I take care of everything and pleased my partner, I would get love, affection, admiration, sex and kindness. * Withholding information: as a child I remember feeling a lot of shame and like I had to hide things to be accepted. As an adult I feel the same but to a lesser degree, I hide mistakes and perceived flaws. * Repress feelings: Childhood, anger, strong emotions were not ok, you just got over them on your own and then everybody pretended nothing had happened. As an adult, I repress a lot of emotions, anger, sadness, shame, sexuality, aggression, hurt, fear, love * Making sure other people dont have feelings: not sure in childhood. As an adult, I treated the emotions about an issue the same as the issue itself. I would say/think The situation is xyz and therefore your feelings are wrong. I am scared of other peoples emotions. * Avoiding problems and difficult situations: as a child I avoided competition because it make me nervous and I avoided trying at things in case I failed. Basically the same as an adult, I also avoid problems in relationships."
"**OYS 40** Age 64 Ht 5'11"" Wt 170 Wife 66 Married 43 Together 46 **Physical** I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy. **Mindset** After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various ""victim"" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long. **Relationship** Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and ""gaming"", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident. I had to consciously up the comfort, touch and praise. By Sunday it seemed like things were back to normal. And I'm taking my meditation time and practice with a renewed diligence."
Going to start adding which BF activity I'm on as I'm not consistently doing these. I will finish up all BF activities by the end of this month. Currently on 15/46. That's 10ish a week. Easy.
PUSSY PASS GRANTED: Special female jail sentence - go to jail every 2 weeks on the weekend LMAO
"im sorry,but what the fuck? thats it,the time to rise is now my brothers! we have to overthrow the government and fix America!"
yes sir spittin fax start a revolution
At least they said that she RAPED him
"omfg, I came here to post exactly that. So often you see that a woman had sex with a boy, and I'm just shocked at how difficult it is for us to call that rape as a society. I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking this. Take my upvote, and go away now."
Thats actually big.
So we can rape and spend every 2nd week in custody? That's easy.
"not every 2nd week, every 2nd weekend"
"Brother tried to kill himself todayHey guys My brother got into a massive argument with my parents accusing them of never giving a shit him and never listening to him about his mental health. Hes a real stubborn type, never will listen to anything new, left wing, blue pill kinda guy, in college, never had a job or a girlfriend. Sits inside all day and beats off and plays video games. I come downstairs because of all the yelling, and see him banging his head against the wall just screaming telling my parents to leave him the fuck alone, my dad trying to grab him to stop him from banging his head, while my mom tells my dad to just let him run his course, and that if he truly wants to kill himself we wouldnt be able to stop him He storms out, steals my bike, so I try to go follow him, but cant catch up. I get my parents to call the cops, so they can find him before he tries anything. They find him over the edge of a bridge, and get him down. Hes in the hospital right now. I was never close with him, or any of my family. What do I do moving forward? Hes so stubborn, so if he doesnt end up killing himself, idk how Ill get him to turn his life around, which I think is the root of his problems. Hes very convicted, and I think because of his depression and low serotonin, he reacts to any attempt to help him change with extreme hostility. Any advice on how to move forward? How to help him? Or at least keep my family from falling apart?"
"hang out with him more. dont try to redpill him, that never works out well in person. if you lift, get him to start lifting with you (assuming he doesnt lift). the gains in both appearance and strength should do at least something. help him find a job, or at least a purpose. help him set goals."
"It's really just out of your control. I lost my brother to suicide when younger so I get the feeling. (a few cousins also) I've dealt with some of my mates being on the edge, again, it was out of my control. All I've learnt to do is listen and try let them get every thought out of their head. (only if you got a strong mind at the time) These psychotic episode phases happen to a lot of men and in my experience they can last up to \~5 years. (after which most dudes become placid enough) So given that he could be like this for a long time, you will need to learn to live with it and continue on your own path. As for your own individual coping, some mates might give you good consolation but most probably won't. I resented my mother for her behavior but as I've aged I realized she had far less of an idea on how to cope than I did."
"And that's okay. Your brother is going to die eventually and if it happens there is nothing you can do. Of course you could try to prevent it from happening but how long will it last? A year? 2? You don't even know if he is going to do all the things you tell him and bring him to. Yeah he might start lifting, for a while. He might be able to feel better, for a while. He might get laid a lot, for a while. It's not in your control. You can only bring him to water but he is the one who needs to drink the water"
"Teach him to DGAF. Hit on girls, plate them, handle tests. I think he'll be in a good place thereafter"
"My little sister killed herself last month, she was by far the closest person in my life. No competition I tried everything bro. Everything. She had attempted multiple times before finally being successful, and at the end of the day nothing myself or anyone did really mattered. As a matter of fact, we spoke the day of, and I told her I was gonna try and buy her a ticket to a music festival to come with me so she had something to look forward to My suggestion would be to try your hardest to get close with him. Spend time with him, make him feel like he has someone to open up to, let him ask you for advice and shit and give it to him. Laugh with him. Let your brother know hes loved"
Give him mushroom. It will change his life
"You should save him, if you don't you will regret it later. The last time I saw my brother was when he stole my bike. He died later on. The only difference is I didn't know he needed help and he told me he was taking my bike to the grocery store last time I saw him. You know shit is wrong, just talk to him and have a bro to bro man to man conversation, and no matter what is said make sure he knows you're on his side. Parents are really estranged from younger people now a days, they have no idea how to connect with them or what's going on in their minds."
Get him started on lifting.
He might have a chemical imbalance. Make sure he doesn't go on antidepresseants from what i hear they only make people worse. He might be low on T so try to convince him to take TRT. It really might help him. Higher testestrone naturally makes a man happy. From there just keep him by your side and show him what he's been missing in the world
"Size of status differential for career womenThis is a throwaway but I had a question for women who are also in high status careers or who are making substantial salaries How does one make a man feel like a hero or that he is needed if, well, you dont really need him (in the traditional sense)? I am not masculine or alpha or aggressive at all, but I have had relationships break down because I didnt make my partners feel needed. Both of my two big breakups were with men in respectable, but not high-powered, careers whod been excited about me because I had a real job. Both breakups happened because they said they felt like I did not need them, and I am trying to figure out if it was due to something that I did wrong or if egos had played a role. If I need to play down aspects of myself or if Id just been with very insecure people. I do not brag about my schooling or my job or anything like that EVER. It is a lesson that has been voiced to me by many of my female mentors and I am well aware that men do not care much about womens accomplishments, Ivy League pedigree, or professional prowess. If anything, I downplay my career (currently a resident) and background. But the fact of the matter is that I have always worked hard, gone to top schools, and stayed on track. I am not a hardened, un-feminine career woman but I am simply driven by what I do (specialty derm) and am good at it. And I feel like I am being penalized for having high income potential on top of it all. After my most recent ex found out that I would be averaging $500k in a few years, he started picking fights and always making me out to be the villain, and I know Im not imagining it. It ultimately ended with the explanation of you dont need me, youll find someone better and leave. Maybe he was letting me down easy but I myself know that I am attractive. My work ethic translates to my physical upkeep, and I have improved my looks since we began dating, if anything. I know that a lot of it has to do with him not feeling like a hero, but I really did try to make sure he felt needed. Its just that I dont really need any saving. I want a partner, and it seems like that is too much to ask. Has anyone else been in this situation?"

This isn't advice. RPW are here to learn to rise above basic instinct. This isn't advice and I don't see participation from you on the men's subs so you do not belong here.
"In today's economy there almost always needs to be two incomes to get a house going. Men will always be a bit emasculated if you make more no matter what you do. That doesnt mean you need to back off your job of healing people. Medicine is such a rewarding career and one women are good at! We are natural healers and caretakers after all! Anyway, the right man will love you because of how well you channel that innate ability. As to making him feel needed, love and support him in his journey, value his decisions, and tell him you love him, how happy he makes you, and the joy his brings to your life. Men are simple in that regard. They want to feel like they're contributing and that they're loved. Show him that he is by making his day easier. Maybe have a carafe of coffee waiting in the morning when you get up for residency. Little things like that."
"What if you dated other doctors, or men in high-paying fields? They dont necessarily have to make exactly the same salary as you, but be in comparably challenging, high-powered jobs. Surely they would be more comfortable with your outlook and lifestyle."
"How did you view your intellect compared to those you were in a relationship with? Im only a nurse, but we still make good income, and for a few months I was making more than my partner. Now, were making about the same. But, my partner recognized the feminine skills that are involved with a caregiving field, and while I know I have a strong intellect, I admire and look up to him so much. For his ideas, leadership, perspective, Im almost always asking his advice or opinion instead of feeling the need to give him advice. I think these things lessened his insecurity regarding the pay difference, and I always make sure he feels like the man of the house. Id definitely up-play the feminine traits that make you good at your job, and find partners you deeply admire and respect. You cant fake that. Honestly, men intimidated enough by income to leave are probably not secure enough in the value they bring to the table as men. I do need my man, not for financial reasons but for 1000 other reasons. Find someone who sees that. Have you dated other doctors?"
"I dated a very successful woman and it was enjoyable. I also have male friends that would/have reacted the same way as you have described. What worked for my relationship with the successful woman, is there was a sense of balance. Although she made more money than me. She'd ""allow"" (for lack of a better word) me to pay for things. I once had planned a trip for her birthday. I had bought tickets to a show and surprised her, but I hadn't purchased the plane tickets yet. We talked about it and decided she would pay for airfare and I would pay for the events, lodging, and majority of food. The trip was lovely. Throughout the relationship we had made a deal. Whoever has the idea, pays. For example if she wants to go to breakfast, she pays. If I mention us going to a movie, I pay. Things like that. Although it isn't all about money. She also ""let"" me be dominant in the bedroom. It is important that men feel like we can be men. When a woman tries to stifle that or if we feel unable to provide. We end up lost. There are many ways other than financial to provide for someone. The men you dated may have been intimidated/insecure of your success. But did you allow them to be men in other situations? It's often small things. Letting us drive places, build things, take over in the bedroom, make decisions on what we do, etc. Even if you paid for majority of the things, we (men) need to feel some sense of control somewhere in the relationship. If you drive everywhere, if we always take your car, if you pay all the bills, buy all the food. It makes us feel unnecessary."
[deleted]
"Are you referring to starfishing? When I was saying dominant in the bedroom. I was meaning more like ""leading"". Like in dancing, allowing the man to take the lead. I maybe should've clarified. She wouldn't just lay there, she would definitely participate, but I would take initiatives on which positions we did (most of the time, not all). I would ramp things up first or remove clothing first. Small things that made me feel some control. These weren't how all of our bedroom experiences went, but many of them."
"Basically, those men are losers. Woman does not need man and man does not need woman. People are in relationships because they want each other. People in relationships lean on each other when needed for emotional support and sometimes financial support - there is not set predefined need that must exist to keep people together. These guys were insecure because they did not hold economic power over you to keep you stuck if you wanted to leave. Women often overcompensate and diminish themselves to essentially baby these emotionally week men into feeling important because they do not have their own self esteem to keep them afloat. All you need is a guy with self esteem. He could be a plumber, a cashier, a manager at a McDonalds or he could be a doctor or lawyer. Guys with low self esteem come from all income levels and guys with high self esteem also exist across the board."

"Is The Surrendered Wife the same as The Empowered Wife?I am sorry if this has been answered, I tried to search it but couldn't find the answer. I own the surrendered wife by Laura Doyle and have read it multiple times, just wondered if the empowered wife offers anything new or if it's just the ""update"". Also any other reason similar to this would be welcomed. I read Dr Laura's ""proper care and feeding husband's"" but her overly Christian stance didn't really fit well since I am agnostic and my husband is an atheist, but there were some helpful insights. Thank you!"
"Christianitys ideas often align well with RP ideas, you shouldnt deny it just because its Christian."
"She viciously attacks him and nobody stops her, some laugh and at the end they asked her if she was okay, imagine if the dude retaliated, all those simps would've jumped on him to death."
"This be some bull fucking shit, the fucking double standards of today"
Poor her. BS
"Yeah, not even a question, she aimed to hurt him there ."
"Bruh, why the hell is someone trying to comfort her at the end? tf"
You know how it is
I woulda pressed charges.
Nail her legally. Got plenty of witnesses.

"VIOLENT protest by feminists to stop discussion on male suicide. Same old story by feminists ""I don't actually want to hear you answer, but I don't want you to talk, and you should join feminism as we have the answers"" As per usual, then literall chant ""look what mens rights did"" when police called!"
"That happened in Toronto a few years back, really proved that feminism is against mens rights"
The hate in that feminists eyes at the end is sad. I feel sorry for her. To be that warped in hate.
"Ask Fwbs if she's going cold/okay? Is this needy?Have been seeing my female FWBs for the last 6 months. She initiated the whole thing. Back in Feb/March she started to tell me she was getting attached. Towards the end of March she seemed to open a lot more and her feelings become quite clear - she was really really into me. We were also having sex everyday at this point Since lockdown, we've barely been able to see each other (we do have a little bit of freedom), perhaps once a week. The last couple of weeks she has started to go a bit cold - definitely less flirty, less emotional etc. by text, although she will message me first everyday. Things started to go south when last week she said she couldn't come round but offered to see me on the weekend to which I said we'll have to see. Anyway, we met on Saturday and had a good time. I then asked her on Monday if she was free to meet but she said she couldn't. I asked her again last night, she initially said no but then later she hinted at seeing me but I didn't pick up on the hint so we didn't. I want to ask her how she's feeling - I'm wondering if she's going a bit cold because she thought I was rejecting her or going cold towards her myself? Is this a weak move to ask her? It feels like I'm asking her where I stand? There is something definitely up with her though but no evidence as such to back this up. She used to message me a lot during work but that has slowed down, as with messaging in the evening - it's all a bit dry. I like her and want to keep this going but want to avoid coming across as clingy and needy. On the one hand, it's like she's falling in love and she's trying to play it cool to not get her feelings hurt - but the on other, I can't tell if she's pulling back because she's getting bored - however, she will still message me first most days. Does anyone have any advice here? Perhaps I could ask her ""I don't want anything to change, but I notice that you've been a bit quieter this week with me...""?"
"Don't ask for her words when she's demonstrating her actions. FWB are just that, if you want to open up a dialogue for emotional exchange then look for a relationship. Friends ask each other if something's up, so just don't frame it as a concern for sexual prospects."
"Dont ask her anything that comes across as you being needy, such as asking her if shes ok or even telling her you dont want anything to change. React by pulling back until she starts to shower higher interest again."
Thanks man. So the last 2 days her messages have all been about work. She's still messaging me first though. Do you think I should send her a pic or flirty message - or wait until she initiates being playful first? My only concern is that I'm going to come off as boring?
"No just wait until she initiates being playful first. Respond to her messages and show interest, just dont be weak, and certainly dont ask her if things are okay."
"Ok thanks bro. It's annoying, she said to me she didn't have time last night then when she was in the car, she said she had taken the wrong turning (hinting she was near mine). Ah well. I'm trying to show a bit of interest but her messages are dry af lol. I just wonder if she's unsure about my feelings towards her..."
bro thats needy as fuck
"some redditor presented this to me earlier and I think it's a non-needy way of evaluating things; simply ask her: > are you happy with what we have going on? Sometimes I feel like I'm chasing too hard, and if I didn't seek you out, you wouldn't think to make plans with me. The last thing I want is for you to go along with something you're not excited about."
Thanks bro. My only problem with this is that once this is said...will it ever go back to being fun...
"That's a good question. It will go back to being fun but you have to make your intentions clear. Do you want to strictly remain FWB/ are you looking for a relationship? I think the blurb above is a sincere non-needy way to evaluate your situation and because it's sincere, if she doesn't respond well to it, you'll know she is probably not worth your time. If she understands the reasoning behind your asking her this, she will respond well. Don't do it over text though. It's sometimes hard to express sincerity through text and it's easier over video call"
What is the line between being a girlfriend and being a wife?Part of using the red pill dating strategy is to marry someone who values you as the woman you are and to keep that marriage healthy and happy. Something I've noticed though is women acting like a wife when they are only a girlfriend which only gives a man more reason not to marry. What do you think is the difference between being a girlfriend and being a wife is? What behaviors should a wife do but not a girlfriend as to not give too much to a man who hasnt fully committed to her yet? I am sure there are many different answers for different women even within this community. As someone who is a girlfriend and not quite a wife Im interested in what you ladies think.
"Some women are married but never act as a wife (sometimes not even as a girlfriend). Same thing with men. It's not about marriage it's about the intensity of commitment between the two people. Whatever the situation, if you're truly commited towards each other you're his women and he's your man."
"Gf- cooks on special dates Wife- organises most meals (depending on how chores are split) and shares grocery/meal prep plans with their partner. Gf- helps pick out a sofa or curtains by making suggestions or comes along for the shopping trip Wife- equal vote on interior design. Empathises with partners preferences they come to a compromise Gf- does laundry as a sweet gesture Wife- has a laundry schedule that fits the partnership Gf- splits meals, he sometimes pays, no financial commitment to each other Wife- comingled finances and a long term financial plan Just a few examples. Hope this helps."
"The problem with this is that a lot of what you've mentioned as 'wife' behaviour would also be the behaviour of a live-in girlfriend. Once people are cohabitating, things like laundry and groceries and cleaning and interior design become both of your responsibilities."
Isnt it in this subs opinion better not to move in together before engagement or marriage? I could be mistaken ...
"I live with my bf, its impractical to not have a meal plan or for just one of us to do laundry while the other does another chore like dishes. Seems like the line is almost too blurry for those who live with one another."
I think most of this sub would also consider a difference between wife and girlfriend as living together or not living together.
"If you are taking risks that could affect the rest of your life for this guy, such as having children, quittimg your job or school, then you are playing wife."
"Dont live together, dont take on his debts, dont buy a pet together, dont get matching tattoos, dont try to change him so he becomes marriage-worthy (in marriage you both need to adapt so as to grow together and be healthy, but if you are dating a douche then youre dating a douche. Hes not a fixer-upper. Hes a lemon). Dont create a fantasy relationship or play house where are acting wife-y because it is entertaining but you are paying zero attention to his reactions or contributions. As in, he could be a deadbeat, lazy, unromantic dingus and you are dressing nice, cleaning up after him, taking lunch to his work, and daydreaming while hes away."
"The lines are quite personal, especially if you're talking about live-in boyfriends/girlfriends. It's very blurry if you're living together. &#x200B; For me, I wouldn't buy a house, share significant finances, or have children with someone to whom I am not married. I probably also wouldn't provide too much input on major life decisions - eg if a boyfriend wanted to move cities or change jobs or have a medical procedure, my input would be much more general and impersonal than it would be with someone to whom I was married. Conversely, I would not sacrifice too much of myself for a boyfriend. I'd never quit a job for a boyfriend, or quit school. Especially if you're making economic sacrifices (eg quitting work to be a stay-at-home partner), I'd caution you against doing that with someone who's not your spouse."

"Why I love my husband[Why I love my husband ](https://imgur.com/a/SYPeeAC) He leads me in the Faith- he had a proven track record *before* I met him. Before I met him; My husband he was active in ministry in his previous church. Once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly. He has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions. He is also sponsoring a child. After I met him; His commitments did not change. Since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family. He has supported me in supporting the missions I am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church. He has continued sponsoring a child (which he did not advertise to me, but I noticed when I saw a letter from world vision). Now we are married; We attend church weekly together. Every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep. He also has a YouTube channel where he creates sermon jams. He has never over promised or broken a promise. The first time I met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me, the door swung back and closed, but by that time he was half way around the car. He cringed hard and tried to brush it off. From that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me. I would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up, but on this occasion and on many he said Ill never do anything for you that I cant keep up. And it was true. He never over promised, he never over extended, he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on. His spending, his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell. He opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together, so I open up my car door now (partly on my insistence, haha). After becoming ill and battling chronic illness, he started opening the door for me again when I was too weak. This is a small example of how he has stayed consistent. He doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences. I always used to joke with my husband why dont you just lie to me?! I dont want to know! When he told me things I did not want to hear. I was joking, partly, as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what I wanted. Well, through Gods grace to me, Im married to a man that is so honest to me, sometimes it is confrontational. He doesnt like above the knee jean shorts, he thinks theyre hideous. He doesnt like t-shirt dresses, he thinks theyre equally hideous (two things I wore often), he doesnt like long skirts on me, he doesnt like short hair etc...etc... it might sound picky, but its directional and in going against what hes said, that would be the true confrontation. It is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like. My husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping. He encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot (can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart?) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue. So, he takes me shopping. Wow, look at my hot fianc! (We were engaged at the time) it made me feel admired and loved, it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time I skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me. In saying that, we didnt buy anything I wasnt comfortable in, a few pairs of jeans, white sneakers, multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it, and I loved him even more for telling me. Ive bought many husband approved dresses since, which he adores. He has clear standards for me. He introduced me to his friends, family and church. In his vetting process of me, he let me have his real personality from the beginning. He made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples, we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldnt want to be like. Couple A- My husband is friends with the husband. He cant stand the wife. Shes overweight, unkind and screams at her husband in public. My hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her. He was blunt and didnt go out of his way to acknowledge her. It was clear he did not respect her. I never wanted that to be me. Couple B- My husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple. His wife was sweet, feminine and absolutely lovely. She was kind and warm to me when I was an outsider in the group. She was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together. She was thin and dressed well. My husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship. He would say things like theyre the real deal I think its amazing shes kept in shape so well after having a child By this feedback, and seeing how he treated these different types of people, and on top of that, knowing how consistent he is as a person, I knew how not to act. His health/ my health He has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy. My husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday. I would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch, but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health. We go shopping together and buy the food I will cook together. I buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy. He has told me he wants veggies in his diet, so thats what I cook. He wants high protein meals, so thats what I cook. I make sure I have the ingredients for all the meals he could want (to a point) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner. He has made what he wants clear. He does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week. He is hyper aware of his body (I always catch him tensing in front of the mirror, haha) and is hyper aware of my body. Hes made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight I am right now is the largest he would like me (Im 58kg, 54) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know Im gaining weight wow honey, look how big your breasts are! Makes me laugh thinking about it. With his help, Ive stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him. Him being honest about his absolute disgust for fat people has helped- and its a mutual thing. I wouldnt ever let him gain weight and I have his support back. He takes care of me and brings me security Financial security; My husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married. By the time I met him, he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof. He made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids. He told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this. God provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning. (Currently not working due to COVID) Health; during our engagement I had a trip to the ER. It turned out I had a cyst on my ovary, we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it. 5 more trips to the ER, specialist and doctors appointments, IUD insertions and a surgery later, Im still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime. This is a chronic condition called endometriosis. I never, ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal. I remember on one trip to the hospital I was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting. In my moments of consciousness I looked to my husband and he kept saying dont worry baby, we are almost there, its going to be ok. I trusted him and let the anxiety go. Its a blurr but I ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief. He waited with me in the hospital the entire day. This happened quiet a few more times. After my operation I went back to the ER and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning. Everytime I looked at him I wanted to cry out of gratitude, I felt so horrid and he was right there with me. I can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when I was in 10/10 pain. In my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion, so much so I couldnt cry out to God, he would put his hand on me and pray for me. He puts me first before his family. We come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons. I love my MIL to death and I dont mind her asking questions, but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how I am at home. Does Anna cook for you everyday? He will respond along the lines of why does it matter? She can do as she likes shes the cook of the home. Oh, poor Anna, she cant speak our language he will respond what do you mean poor Anna? Shes a lion. You should be the one learning English. He will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me, he does not complain about me to his family nor friends. He will not let his friends joke about our sex life. He does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though I am extremely willing to. He tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit (him and me) are most important and everything else is secondary. We of course love his family a lot, especially his parents, but hes made it clear we wont partake in anything just for the sake of tradition. Bonus points: -He gets along amazingly with my Dad, we all hang out all the time and its the best part of my life! -His family love me (they joke constantly they love me more than they love him!) -He is good with children and loves his nephews, we even baby set sometimes. -He grew his beard for me."
"> He doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences. This is a thing about my husband that always makes me grateful, humbled and still amazed."
So true. Every time. Its true love because they love us enough to tell us
How did you meet your husband?
Great question. I moved to a new area and one of our mutual friends told me he lived in the same area. He said that his friend (my husband) was a great man and a faithful Christian. With that introduction we went out for coffee and never looked back. Being introduced is a lovely way to meet someone and there can be confidence in their character and accountability!
"Wow. Pray for me too, I want to be like ur husband. I want to inspire my husband. But i guess its no use unless the so is willing to go down this path. You are lucky and chosen one to be close to God."
"It has not been easy, I feel undeserving at many times. I will pray for you and your husband. You are in a good place to learn how to bring out the best in him xx"
I try hard. But he just thinks that his spirituality should be his own concern nd he cant do anything unless he hears the voice from within.
"I admire people with pure strong core values, the values that are the very essence of what makes up ""you"" and you can see it being reflected in every decision he or she makes. To ignore or step down from your values to please some third party or letting yourself go for a moment is to lie to yourself. Your husband sounds amazing, and you two sounds like you have found your key to success. I'd love to ask what his core values are, but I have a sense that I already know. I cherish your partnership and thank you for sharing!"
Such kind words I am humbled. It isnt always perfect but there is definitely a peace in our marriage I can only contribute to our faith in God. The core values my husband holds are all centred in Christ. I cross posted this to r/RPChristians as I hoped it would inspire them to see what a fellow believer is doing and how grateful myself as a wife is to be treated how I am. I constantly feel undeserving and his actions convict me to treat him even better as a result. Xx
"I'm 21 and unmarried. What should I be doing right now to prepare myself to be a good wife and mother?As the title says, I'm an unmarried 21 y/o female who aspires to be a wonderful homemaker for my future children and husband. I want to know what skills I should be honing right now to prepare myself for this role. My mother passed away from cancer when I was quite young so my brother and I mostly raised ourselves. Due to this, I never really got to observe and learn how to run a household as a woman. I want to set a good example for my future children and the best way to do that would be to learn and practice these skills right now so that I am prepared for their arrival. Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!"
"Learn practical skills! Cooking obviously, but also things like time management and prioritizing things. I really like the YouTube channel Mrs Midwest for videos on femininity. Im 27 now and am a very different person than I was at 21. I got married at 22, and my advice would be to really take a hard look at yourself and start improving. For me, and most people at 21, immaturity is huge, so just learning to handle my emotions, and reactions, and mental state with a more mature mindset would have saved me a lot of trouble."
Thank you for your comment. I have been teaching myself how to cook from scratch over the last couple of years but there are still so many things I need to learn. I was also recently gifted a sewing machine and have been trying to teach myself how to mend and make clothing of my own. It's been a lot of fun so far! I will check out Mrs. Midwest. I have seen her mentioned on this sub before but have yet to check out her channel. Thanks again!!
"Work on being a good person first. One who can support yourself financially, live frugally, be kind to others, take care of your body and health, and grow your mind. That is the best start! I highly recommend journalling as a way to start self-improvement - recording where you are and where you want to be is vital. &#x200B; Big hugs. I'm happy to take questions by private message if you like - it can all get very specific and personal, and growing up without a mother must have been very very difficult."
Thank you for your great advice. I will try my best to implement it into my current lifestyle. Best wishes to you!
"Depending on where you live, there may be some low cost community classes for cooking, sewing, home maintenance. I suggest reading the classics, furthering your education, however you can afford. Try to seek out new experiences to become a well-rounded, interesting person. Art history, music, world history, motorcycle maintenance ;) Best wishes!"
"Get your finances in order! Any high value man is going to appreciate a woman who knows the value of a dollar. I know way too many men who are frustrated by their wives' lack of financial awareness. This means keeping your debt down or having a plan to pay it back, such as in the case of student loans. It means doing what you can yourself, like trimming bangs or painting nails. It means dressing cute on the cheap and driving an older model car. Know where your money is going and who you owe, if you have to owe anyone. My husband was in oil when we met. He drove a paid off suped up Dodge pickup and paid for every lavish date. I wore dresses from Goodwill and makeup from the drugstore. I worked two jobs and the only luxury item I owned was my purse and my phone. He didn't judge me for being poor. He appreciated that I knew what it took to survive on my own. He's the only one of his friends who doesn't have regular arguments with his wife about her spending habits."
"Focusing on self awareness and self improvement in general will put you miles and miles ahead of other girls. Hypergamy is subconsciously strengthened by all the content most women and men take in on a daily basis (like Netflix, product advertisement, big news networks, etc.), so being aware and mindful of that will help you to be avoidant of it. Self improvement topics such as finances, ethics, health, and productive hobbies are a great alternative to unhealthy mainstream content. Strengthening yourself in these areas will help prepare you for real problems and avoid the ""dellusion"" that many beautiful women find themselves in during their 20s before waking up to a nightmare in their 30s when the constant attention stops being thrown at them. And of course, always put God first. Good luck!"
"I think this is an awesome response. I don't even need to comment, this was said better than I could have. I want to add additional stress on focusing on self awareness and self improvement. Learn to understand your emotions (what they are and where they are coming from) and learn how to have a conversation about those emotions. Understand that emotions, although powerful may not always be rational or about what triggered them. That doesn't make the emotions less important, just that they should be approached differently than logic."

Banned for asking a question to a feminist subredditI dont understand this at all. I went to a feminist subreddit because I wanted to gain knowledge from real perspectives. The first answer I got was want a cookie? and I was banned from the sub 2 minutes later. Anyone have similar stories?
"yeah, there are not really big on truth, their approach is more of a brainwashing, and if you come from other angle, you ether get indoctrinated or get banned. On some of reddit ""safe baubles"" they dont believe men nave any problems and we are constant oppressors of everything. Closest i got to some real conversation was from a guy from r/MensLib, but it felt so hand feed opinion that it creeped me out and later i checked the the fact he gave me, and its basically same lies of cherry picked ""research"" as feminist"
"It's not that the sub ""isn't big on truth"", it's that he's the hundreth+ dude to come into the sub asking basic Feminism 101 questions when that is NOT what that sub is for. If he had read the rules, he'd know which was the appropriate sub to post in."
"They are indoctrinated into thinking that their position is the morally dominant one. And they expect you to approach them as if you are lower than them, educating(I should say brainwashing) yourself first into their ideology and then pretend as if you're on a lower tier of 'enlightenment' than they are. In short, stay away from toxic feminist groups, it's bad for your brain, might be fun to read the shit they post sometimes though. Cheers!"

">Debate and basic questions about feminism belong on /r/Ask_Radical_Feminists. Looks more like a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of place."
Why do you say that?
"Well, theres a few things here: First of all, your question was really lazy. You went there and basically said Try to convince me and thats not really how you get people to want to invest their time in you. Also, as was said before, you didnt adhere to the rules. So dont be too surprised. Also, why did you ask on that sub specifically? If you search for feminism in the searchbar, youll see more moderate and open subs before r/gendercritical (one of the first ones is r/askfeminists ffs, another, r/feminisms is also centered around debate, although not the kind you were looking for, but they wouldve probably taken your question a bit nicer anyway). Those have different policies on asking questions. And lastly, again: Why *that* sub? Why are you asking the radical part of a group to define the group for you? And lets not even get into the fact that this group is (to say it nicely) disliked by many other feminists for excluding trans people (thats who these feminists mean with the term terf). So asking *them* specifically for a definition just seems like you went out of your way to ask the group that least wants to talk to you."

"The 80/20 concept is inherently flawed, based on data that doesn't represent the population, and selectively ignores parts of that data that make men look bad.I'm a guy. I like a lot of what TRP has to offer. It helped put words to things I had felt and experienced for a long time. But it's very clear that certain pieces of TRP wisdom have spent far too long in the echo chamber and become dogmatized and mythologized beyond all rational sense as a result. The 80/20 concept is a prime example of this. I often see it referred to as the 80/20 ""rule,"" and see guys use it to show that 20% of all men are Chads running a harem. The 80/20 rule is, so far as I can tell, based of a combination of a misappropriated Pareto principle and some very selective data pulled from [Tinder](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) and [OkCupid](https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/). The most glaring issue with treating 80/20 as a rule for romantic interaction generally is that the data isn't based on the general population - it's based on data extracted from two very specific dating sites. The best you can say is that it applies on Tinder and OkCupid. That does not therefore mean it applies to the general population. A small percentage of the population use these apps. They are a product. They attract a certain kind of person, often for a specific purpose. Tinder dynamics =/= dating dynamics. The Tinder study is so flawed it's hardly worth looking at. It's based off the self-reported data of 27 women. 27. Millions of women on the app, and only 27 were interviewed. So beyond not being representative of the general population, that study isn't even representative of Tinder. The OkCupid data is a bit more solid. What does it show? Well there are a few things to note: Yes, it appears women on OkCupid are pretty brutal in regards to how they rate the attractiveness of males. 80% of men on OkCupid were rated as below ""medium"" attractiveness. But again, this isn't an analysis of dating in general - this is an analysis of how women on OkCupid rate men on OkCupid. It's possible that women on OkCupid are just pickier about looks compared to the general population. It's possible men on OkCupid are just uglier than the general population. It's possible they just aren't good at dressing, grooming, and taking good profile pictures (and having looked over the shoulder of female friends as they swiped, I can confirm there's a lot of dudes who probably look pretty decent but absolutely suck as presenting themselves well). 20% of men were rated as above average. I've often seen this ""study"" used to confirm that 20% of men ""get"" 80% of the women. That's nonsense. And here's why: What TRP conveniently omits from this analysis is that while the women were pretty brutal in terms of who they rated as physically attractive, women also largely went on to initiate contact with that same block of men they just rated as physically below average. Look at the graph. In terms of who women are actually willing to pursue they basically the opposite of picky in regards to looks. Arguably this is evidence that women are *not* particularly shallow - they have high standards when it comes to looks, but other things in a guys profile - humor, career, charisma, hobbies - prompt them to contact these men. What about guys (*on OkCupid)*? Well we're much more fair about attractiveness ratings. It's a nice bell curve peaking right around ""medium,"" although I have to imagine the thought process here went something like ""mm... boobs... hot..."" But who do guys (*on OkCupid)* contact? That same study that ""proves"" 80/20 found that two thirds of all male attention is focused on the top one third of women. So why isn't there a 66/33 rule? Well because that would make men look like shallow horndogs drooling after only the hottest of the hottest women who are way out of their league and then complaining when they strike out. It would make men look bad. So TRP ignores it, rather than codifying it as a rule for all human interaction the same way they did with the data on women. Well that's not quite correct - they only did this with the data that makes women look bad. The part that shows that women happily initiate contact with far more than just the top 20% conveniently gets omitted from this ""rule."" Finally, just on a common sense level, one fifth of all men are not Chads. Think of any time you've seen a pretty random subset of the population, have *one in five* of the men present been jacked, jawlined, charismatic pussy-slayers? No. Not even close. Probably more like 1-2%. And do these men get a lot of sex? Yes. Do they probably get sex from the hottest women? Yes. Does this mean there's no sex available for everyone else? Not even close. A majority of men report having multiple sexual partners over the course of their lives - the 0-1 category is a minority and, considering that many religious people who weren't trying to get laid before marriage are in the 1 category, it's probably even smaller. Only between 12-14 percent of adults aged 20-24 have never had sex. This number drops to around five percent for adults aged 25-29, and by age 44, only around 0.3 percent of adults report never having sex. So if your goal is to be able to effortlessly hook up with different hotties five times a week, yeah, sorry, you're shit out of luck. That's only something Chad (or a very very rich guy) gets to do. But you don't need to be a Chad or in the top 20% of men looks-wise to have a normal, happy, healthy sex life, or even to get laid quite a bit. CMV Edit: been bouncing this around for hours.

"Pareto principle has a lot of explanation in nature. Thinking that people are so different from the rest of the nature, is absurd. Pareto principle can definitely explain casual sex statistics. 20% of men can get it easier than 80%. Yes, less women are interested in casual sex than men, which gives guys who seek it less edge. Women dont find most of the guys attractive. Maybe not 80%, but it is high percentage. Vast majority of guys started dating when they got their finances right, which points that he was unattractive before he started cashing out. 80/20 concept is not flawed."

"This is how you look at and use statistics. You don't just take the numbers and run with them for without doing due diligence (I mean you can but it just seems unwise). Stats are a representation of data collected, so already there is problem here because a large group of people aren't being accounted for, and even what that data collected means may be different than what is being shown. You also really can't use statistics as an end all be all to generalize people."

Philip Davies MP: 'Attempts to keep a child away from one parent should be classed as domestic abuse'
"Agreed. Expect feminists to lobby hard against this by claiming all men are abusers so women need this right ""for the good of the children""."
this guy is legend btw for MRA. He talked about MGM in pariment. Constantly talking about MRAS and even trolling feminists hard
"If he wasn't a Tory, I'd fully support him. It's unfortunate he has to deal with the feminist likes of Jess Phillips in the opposition."
Someone as extreme and openly misandry can be quite useful in exposing the reality of feminism and inequalities against men. The people who are the real problem are those who share the exact same world-view as Philips but manage to control their emotions slightly better and express their misandry and policies to harm men in a calmer and slightly politer manner.

"Women don't like sensitive men. But rather men with a *sensitive side*.Traits that are most commonly liked in men (by women) are: - dominance - assertiveness - confidence That turns women **on**. When women say ""I want a sensitive guy"", it translates to ""I want a guy with a *sensitive side*"". Women don't really want a dude that is sensitive all the time. Nice and polite **all the time**. Respectful **all the time**. In bed especially. Women don't generally want a sensitive dude, that is gonna rub their shoulders every time before sex, and be gentle during sex. Women want to be fucked sometimes. Rough. Dirty talk too. And a sensitive dude can't really offer you that. However, what they really want is that when they're upset, or sad, for men to be gentle, kind and caring. They want the man to be able to switch in between his behaviour at appropriate times. Being able to communicate your feeling clearly, and similar. That's what women mean by ""sensitive guy""."

That sounds accurate. But is it? I really don't know.
To be fair I've always heard girls say they want a guy with a sensitive side specifically. I've never heard them say they want a sensitive man
"I have never wanted a sensitive guy, even in the way described by this post. Being treated gently by men turns me off. I feel like a big part of maintaining long term sexual attraction involves the man retaining some distance and mystery. Him rushing over to cuddle you when you cry (I can't even remember the last time I cried as an adult) or hashing out your problems like a girlfriend is the opposite of that."
"When I first opened this thread I was concerned you'd be another one of the retards who assumes that being Alpha is all about being an asshole. I am grateful that is not the case. A hard lesson you will learn when you become successful, with girls or money or career or whatever, is that success breeds terrible envy and deep-seated jealousy. Betas are not more likeable, they are more compliant. Mushy turds if you will. The way you write suggests that you are in fact kind to people and that their happiness matters to you. The second part is the dangerous part. Understand that everyone's happiness is their own responsibility, and some cannot help but malign themselves when they see your path to Greatness. If you want to, try to explain the purpose of your self improvement and lifestyle to your male friends. Some will get it, some won't. That second group needs to be left behind. The first group however may join you or understand, and your friendship will grow stronger than ever"
"Great answer. As a side-note, I would add that since I've become more successful, I started to understand more how hot women can develop such a bitchy attitude: when you're attractive, everyone (men and women) wants a piece of you. Some want to fuck you, some just want to be seen with you, some want to be validated by you. At the beginning it's nice, it boosts your ego. But it gets old real quick, and it's hard not to be mean to the 20th person who comes bother you and doesn't get the clear clues that you're not interested. Part of becoming Chad is learning to deal with constant attention, and using it to raise others up, instead of putting them down."
"The crab bucket mentality is real. It's hard to have perspective on your high school friends when that's all you've known. Sometimes you get out in the world and realize they are all slugs. Hang around more high quality, accomplished people and less of them will have this trait."
Alpha is likeable AF but have the balls to be the asshole to put someone in place or stick up for someone who needs help or shame someone who letting themselves go. All in all can control himself
"Alpha and likeable are not antonymous. Perhaps you need to branch out and find men who are similar to you. Iron sharpens iron. When you hang around equally successful men or men more successful than you. Just always strive to improve and learn from these men but also understand what you can bring to the group and they can learn from you also. Guys who legitimately have your back and could help you, vice versa in times of need. This is healthy . Just don't fall into the same trap of being resentful and jealous when in company of such men. That is being true beta."
"You need new friends. I have multiple friend groups from high school that I still interact with 8 years later. Almost everyone in those groups, from the most beta to the most alpha, wish each other success in every aspect of life (including getting girls). If someone acts like a faggot (myself included) we're quick to call them out on their bs."

"If they're bringing more negativity than positivity to your life it's best just to start phasing yourself out of that group.

Good luck brother"
"Sorry to hear. This isn't something where you can just change your in the moment behavior, and everyone else will calm down. You'll have to change crowds - which obviously leads to other problems."
"Do you think breasts are inherently sexual?Sorry if this sounds a bit scattered, I'm just writing a stream-of-consciousness about my thoughts on this right now. This question has been haunting me for many years. I remember this one time I was at the beach when I was young and I was watching the boys around me wearing just their swim trunks and how free it must feel not to have to wear a top, and I felt this sort of painful longing. I felt sad that girls just couldn't do that, because boobs are ""inappropriate"". Now that I'm older, I have many more thoughts about this. I still feel the painful longing I felt when I was younger whenever I see men just being allowed to have their shirts off and not have to cover their nipples. And I just wonder, why is it that boobs are seen to be nearly as sexual, if not *just* as sexual, as genitalia? There is really no difference between male nipples and female nipples except for the female breast's function to breastfeed, which requires more fatty tissue. My theory on this is that women's bodies are just so objectified and oversexualized in every way that even body parts that seem biologically and inherently sexual really *aren't*. Rather, everyone in (at least western) societies have become socialized to cater to the male gaze, which views women through a lens that hyper-sexualizes women for male benefits. I do not think that female breasts are inherently sexual; rather, our response to viewing breasts in a purely sexual way is a result of being trained over and over and over that breasts are for men's sexual viewing pleasure. We have sexualized women's breasts so much that women cannot even breastfeed their children in public, a normal biological need, without being hyper-sexualized and condemned. Theoretically, I think it is possible for women's breasts to be seen as just as nonsexual as men's are. It will take many, many years of deconstructing the male gaze and removing men from the position of the ""default"" human being (thereby removing marginalization), but I think it can happen. For the most part, I believe we have a choice of which body parts we choose to sexualize or not sexualize (besides *maybe* genitalia). For instance, biologically, cis straight women overwhelmingly prefer men with larger shoulder to hip ratios, but you do not see men's shoulders being covered up and hypersexualized. I do not think that is because men's shoulders are actually ""less sexy"" than women's breasts; rather, I believe it is because most societies have been designed for men, with men being the ""viewers"" and women being the ones who are viewed. And so, men's preferences and decisions on what is ""sexy"" or not have taken precedence and are thought of as being universal, while women's desires and what body parts they view as sexy on men are mostly silenced or not recognized to be as sexy as any body part women possess, because women are, as we have been trained, inherently sexual, while men are not. In general, sexualizing women's nipples while not sexualizing men's nipples creates an imbalance where women are taught to be inherently ashamed of the body they possess because it is automatically ""sexual"", while men are taught that their body is the normal, default body that is allowed to view women as objects for their sexual viewing pleasure. Whoops, this was a lot longer than I meant it to be. But I'm curious, what are your thoughts on this? **TLDR:** I believe women's breasts are over-sexualized because we have been socialized to view women through a male gaze which believes women's bodies to be inherently sexual. This, in turn, sexualizes body parts that are not actually sexual. I think it is theoretically possible to desexualize women's breasts in time, when men are no longer deemed to be the ""default"" human and society is not designed solely for men's benefits and desires. **Edit:** I also want to add that I am bisexual and nonbinary (AFAB). While I find women's boobs to be sexually attractive, I do not think of boobs *only* in that way and I do not think of women as being inherently sexual objects because of their bodies. I would have no problem living in a world where women can walk around with their tops off, because boobs are beautiful in ways that are more than just sexually, and so are women as a whole. I think boobs are a body part like any other, and they definitely can be sexy, but they are not aggressively inherently sexual and inappropriate like we have been ingrained with. Society has an undeniable problem with looking at women as parts rather than as people."

Those are typically the people saying that. > If your ""worst"" is living in a studio while you do your residency or another modest apartment while you get your MBA That's not a ""worse"". That's NORMAL. Hell, he's at least living on his own. > Your argument is essentially ""only date people who are already successful and avoid the ones who merely have potential,"" YES. Because potential doesn't mean shit. > Successful high value men get married to the women who are with them when they had potential That's highly subjective. Remember, Jeff Bezos did the same and then his wife for someone younger."

What are you talking about? Men invest in women all the time.
You do realize that men say that for women were saying that like crazy a few years back? A way to get even with women who used that same logic against them.
So you act like batshit crazy radfems and then you wonder why I treat you like batshit batshit crazy radfems?
How the domestic violence industry grows revenues and profits
"Ah, why are evil people always so clever"
If they weren't they would have been caught and punished a long time ago.
This sounds outrageous. Where can I learn more about what happened?
"Best place to start would be the Facebook page in question. The admins there are quite responsive and would likely be quite amenable to showing you how/where they sourced the supporting data. Probably also worth doing deeper reading for greater context, such as scrutinising VAWA, and the incorporation of the Duluth Model into Australian policy, such as here; https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/family-violence-improving-legal-frameworks-alrc-cps-1/19-integrated-responses-and-best-practice/introduction-24/ Its a multi-faceted problem."
"What does step 3 mean? If abused guy calls line, and tells story of being abused, how do they admit its a perp line? Do they draw out ways in which he retaliated or provoked it and label it a female victim of abuse?"
I'd say they basically just start asking him 'what he did to her'.
"Didnt happen to me personally but someone very close to me was physically, emotionally and psychologically abused by his (now ex) gf. He called that line and it was like talking to a wall he said. In his words (slightly paraphrased) when I said she was assaulting me its like all they could hear was I was assaulting her. Im convinced these services are maliciously sexist. You have to remember the Duluth Model just straight up doesnt allow for men to be victims. Its like trying to jam a square peg in a round hole for them. They just cant conceive it or refuse to."
"Yes that's exactly what happened but I had no idea this is how they've potentially padded out domestic abuse statistics. Would be nice if we could get more detail on this tactic as it wouldn't surprise me. This is how feminists tried to pad the numbers of sexual assault on campus with their ridiculous 1 in 4 statistic, they were claiming that a bunch of women who experienced unwanted contact etc. were sexually assaulted. The reason I bring up detail is because if we point out exactly what these feminist domestic violence helplines are doing then we can not only point out these potentially fraudulent helplines for the world to see we can put to rest the bullshit that feminists are pulling where they use domestic violence statistics as an excuse to ignore men."

"I tried to have a discussion about lookismIt backfired on me; I got told that the reason why people are mean to me is because Im insecure. I wish people would just take responsibility for their own actions and how they treat people instead of blaming the other person. Im not gonna argue and say that Im not insecure, but Im not a bad person for being insecure. People act like insecurity is some sort of disease and that I am untouchable because of it, when we all really know the true reason why I am untouchable. Even then, does being insecure really give people a right to be horrible to you?It all just makes me so sick"
Fuck gaslighting I also had similar reaction when discussing racism
anyone else noticed how mental issues are seen as a moral fail in women? for example when ppl use daddy issues as an insult
Reminds me of the racist comments I get. Truly gross behavior
Use to happen to me all the time. I don't bother anymore.
"You can never actually talk to people and say ""I'm ugly"". You can say ""I'm not photogenic"", maybe even ""I'm not conventionally attractive"". I don't know who you said it to but be very, very careful even whom you bring it up to. People knowing this is how you feel about yourself gives them power over you and can be used against you in mixed company. People don't think insecurity is a disease, and they can't even fucking describe what it mean than admitting you have doubts yourself; they're saying you are choosing to be ""insecure""...and thus warrant unkindness It's bullshit"
"This is excellent advice, I wish I had really applied this when I was 18"

"How I succeeded in datingAfter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game, flirting and other BS that there is out there, I came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit. Sure, you could learn something of value from there, but most of it BS. So, I started using my common sense and got success. I started working out. Not just because I wanted to date hot girls, but because I wanted to improve my health. This after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling. I improved my diet, which was now balanced and vegetarian. I did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though. And, I started working out. Hired a trainer and started finally. There were many points in time where I simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed. It was painful, but worth it in the end. Now, for a year I have not been sick. Not even a cold. Secondly, I started visiting a good barber. I can't emphasise how important is having a good hair cut. After getting my haircut, I kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle. I have specs so I bought a stylish pair of eyewear. Thirdly, I improved my fashion sense. I started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes. If you want to attract females, better ask them what suits you. Besides, they have a much better fashion sense than males. Meanwhile, while executing all this, I started socialising. Like just going out there. Started chatting up any girls that I liked. Initially, I had nerves. I was frantic, nervous. But gradually I started gaining confidence. I read somewhere that when girls reject you, think of it as their loss instead of yours. Initially, I will be honest, I got depressed upon rejection. It shattered my confidence, but I kept at it. I had to. And eventually, this benefited me. I became desensitised to rejection. Whenever I got rejected, I got a bit sad but moved on. Then after some time, I finally got success. Hence my confidence increased. But a big part of it was me getting fit. I cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence. No longer had a pot belly. No longer was I skinny. So I would say this, going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously. You do not need to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just be fit. Muscular. Don't go overboard with it, lol. Another thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is:- * I do not dip my pen in crazy ink. * No games. No push pull. Be genuinely busy. Develop constructive hobbies. Develop interests. Be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life. Not to get chicks. * Never pursued a girl that was playing games. I have my self respect intact. No girl is worth losing it. I have a rule about dating. If after first date, the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation, I consider it to be the end of it. Never drive single handedly. After some time if a girl is not reciprocating, or is confused. I tell them to make up their mind. * Be forth coming once you start dating about what you want. No pussyfooting about what you want. Do not be friends if you are attracted. You will end up suffering. * Do not be manipulative. Do not put a nice guy act. Girls can see through it within seconds. They might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything. * Do not stalk. Do not be pathetic. No means no. Develop a thick skin and learn to move on. tldr:- Use your common sense. You do not need a love guru or a dating guide or any other BS."
"Very good post, to the point and makes complete sense, It's a shame how many people still rely on manipulation and gimmicks to get girls. It's always better to be the best YOU instead of trying to be someone else. What gave you the push to finally go out and approach? :)"
"Short story Redirected anger constructively. It killed my nervousness. Long story I had a guy friend tell me that the girl I was interested in was out of my league. I told to get lost, lol. Still approached the girl, she said the same to me, lol. I was enraged. Then an idea came to me. I approached her friend after some time lol. Told her she easily stood out in their group. She chuckled at this, and the first girl was very angry. It was a power move. I saw that anger destroyed my nervousness if I redirected it correctly."
What do you mean? What happened? Explain! Explain! Explain!
"Instead of being angry about getting rejected, he used that energy and pursued her friend and made the first girl jealous. Never be bitter and learn to move on is the lesson i think."
"Basically you say you completely discarded all the things mentioned here, just to follow up to list the things, which are also very often mentioned in this subreddit. Long story short, you discarded shitty advice and followed up on the good advice, even if you saw more of the former. Good job, but believe me, all of the things you mention in your post are also mentioned here like everyday. The key is just to disregard all of the bullshit as soon as you sense it, which you apparently did."
"Indeed. This post is made not as a guide, but to reaffirm this. Most of the people like you said know this, but are in doubt whether it will work. Sometimes, all they need is encouragement based on it working for others. That's why I wrote this, as a way to provide positive reinforcement the scenario for using common sense."
It all sounds great except not asking for a second date unless the girl asks .
"Suit yourself. I do not like to gout on dates with girls who are not interested or excited. You should not always be expected to make a move. Basically, what I am looking for is positive reinforcement from them. If they are excited to go out with me, it won't work."

"Avoiding online shopping while working at home and spending more time on my phoneJust a tip for those being tempted by online shopping while at home more - Ive recently been inundated by sales emails for companies whos newsletters I subscribe to, but when sales are good, generally dont send too many emails. Due to the retail struggle the frequency of these sale, sale, sale buy, buy, buy emails has exploded - its both distracting and tempting. I need my emails on my phone with notifications on in case its something important. So Ive gotten into the habit of unsubscribing each time I get one - it feels very liberating and Im reducing the issue bit by bit."
"I catch myself window shopping a LOT. I think I have cart items in both wish, amazon, AND Etsy my thing is to keep my monthly spending the same and as long as I dont go through with the purchase, I can still budget when payday comes and little by little with patience Ill accumulate all of the things I want. I just find it better to still buy things that make me feel good but instead of maxing out a credit card I just budget a little more and work towards it"
"I do this too - or I wait a few days after seeing something I really like. If Im still thinking about it days after seeing it, then Ill allow myself to get it if its within my budget. I also try to visualise how itll fit in with my existing wardrobe. A few people I know have real issues with stress/ impulse online shopping, so this unsubscribing technique is a good behaviour retraining exercise for them. After doing this for a week so far I barley get anymore promotional/ sales emails. Some have been from shops I never shop at anyhow, so easy to let go of those"
> So Ive gotten into the habit of unsubscribing each time I get one - it feels very liberating and Im reducing the issue bit by bit. Good for you! It's feel good to have that sense of self-control. I'm a minimalist & that is something they touch on a lot as well: self-discipline
Im a minimalist too - I sold some clothes on eBay recently as Im making a capsule wardrobe- used those earnings to purchase the outfit gaps I needed to fill (but each 5 items I sold got me one new piece) so it was an effective way for me to downsize

Betsy DeVos to end Obama-era 'kangaroo courts' by protecting rights of accused on campus
"The subject is idiotically treated as so controversial, even though it's blatantly the undeniable truth, that even the Washington Times couldn't help themselves from putting ""kangaroo courts"" in quotation marks. Yes she said it, no you shouldn't permit even an ounce of doubt that it isn't a totally accurate assessment of the situation."
"'Kangaroo court' is a biased term. Journalists are supposed to be unbiased. If these are kangaroo courts (and obviously they are) we should arrive at that conclusion from the unbiased information presented within the piece, not from the journo telling us they are. Quoting someone to sneak bias or inflammatory/clickbait language into your headline while dodging blame for it is just one of the many shitty journalistic practices taking hold in the media and it should be opposed."
"How can it be biased, if it's true? Bias would be shying away from calling a spade a spade, because it's politically convenient or expedient."
"Calling them 'kangaroo courts' in the title biases the reader towards that conclusion before the evidence is presented. It's also not the journalist's words, which is why it's in quotation marks, but *it is* the journalist's sentiment (as displayed in the article). The journo gets to call them kangaroo courts, but maintains plausible deniability of having done so themselves. It's a dishonest practice."
But but - believe all women. But Tara isnt a woman.
"That's not nearly sufficient enough, university tribunals are meant to handle cheating and plagiarism, not sexual assault! Such cases need to be referred to the justice system. &#x200B; 1. Because expulsion is not an adequate punishment for such a crime. 2. Because in the justice system there is due process, with an investigation and the right to a lawyer! The fact the feminist want to keep this in the universities' widely inadequate hands shows that this is not about punishing rapist, but rather gaining control over anyone they could falsely accuse!"
This is a fact.
And Biden has now vowed to restore the kangaroo courts when elected. He sure doesnt like other men to get fair treatment.
"This is a huge milestone. It has rightfully made the criteria for what's considered sexual assault considerably higher. There are over 600 lawsuits regarding these gross violations for the accused. (see here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQNJ5mtRNzFHhValDrCcSBkafZEDuvF5z9qmYneXCi0UD2NUaffHsd5g4zlmnIhP3MINYpURNfVwSZK/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQNJ5mtRNzFHhValDrCcSBkafZEDuvF5z9qmYneXCi0UD2NUaffHsd5g4zlmnIhP3MINYpURNfVwSZK/pubhtml#) ) As you can see the vast majority are men and they've seen some success in the courts to remedy their right to due process violations. So much injustice has occurred for the sake of addressing sexual assault on campuses. Unfortunately from reading a few cases these men still face an uphill battle in proving gender bias of these ""kangaroo courts"" in court, especially in instances where the committee convinces the accuser that he/she was sexually assaulted when he/she was unsure."
"Need the Truth20 M virgin. Im a pretty good looking guy. Had a good amount of opportunities in high school to have sex but never sealed the deal because I was to stupid to realize it, or honestly just to much of a pussy. Currently reading Models by Mark Manson and in general have a better understanding on relationships and attraction. Main question is Im scared of girls not finding me attractive knowing that Im a virgin. The thought keeps me up at night and I want to know if any of this attraction stuff even matters if they find out Im a virgin."
When you find the right girl it wont matter. Ive had a few girls be turned off and ghost me when they found out I was a virgin. I still am at 22. Some girls just straight up say that they dont wanna mess with virgins. I dont really see how its that big of an issue but I try to not worry about it anymore cuz Ill find the right girl. For hookups it would make sense but if a girl is looking for a relationship then she shouldnt care.
Yeah but I want to get this off my back ASAP. Forgot to mention I have received oral if that matters
"Truth be told, don't bother telling just have fun it's not that complicated."
"Bad idea, if he gets to the sex part and busts his nut almost instantly (as most of us do our first time) then it could cause more issues."
"Truth is your insecurities will hurt you more than being a virgin will. If you're secure about being a virgin and you don't make it a big deal, then it won't be a big deal."
The girl doesn't know you are a virgin and it is not something that you need to disclose anyway. No girl will ask you if you are a virgin or not.
"Hey! Sex should be something built on trust, honesty, intimacy and love. How can you create such an environment without telling her the truth? You cant't! If you tell her, it will create closeness and she will understand why you act inexperienced and she will be able to ""help"" you (e.g. show you how a certain position works) and answer all your questions ... and she will not expect the sex of an experienced guy ... You will enjoy the sex more if you don't have to hide your inside ... Also, you will get used to really open up to your partner and that is the base of every really good relationship ... Maybe she will reject you, but rejection is a natural part of life and will always happen no matter what you do ... But if you just want the superficial sex portrayed by our degenerate pop-culture, it does not matter what you do anyways - just go ahead and lose your ""virgin status"" ... But I recommend the honest way ..."
If she loses attraction because you're a virgin then she's a loser. Honestly lots of women would like the blank slate to train you in what they like.
"We both are in the same boat XD, but I'm a couple of years older. Also lost handful of opportunities because of being stupid or not realizing they were flirting with me. Maybe I'm not the person you would want to advice you, but when I would be about to lose my V-card and that girl asks me that question, I would say the truth. If she's comprehensive, I'd try to make her enjoy that moment, but if a LMR occurs, it doesn't matter, there will be more girls who find me attractive. I've also read Models some months ago, and I noticed an improvement as I was starting to kiss some girls after 3 years and a half of not doing that, until we were locked-down. I still have to apply some lessons from the book. I'm due to read also No More Mr. Nice Guy!, but I can't as I have some workload and I don't find the moment to read it. Currently, I'm centered on my studies, girls can wait till this situation improves. Good luck, bro ;) Hope we soon can experience that thing, but if not, we have to be patient"
Girl creates fake account and talks about her own rape and then blamed it Men who refused to entertain the issue
"RIP all the male femininist who were virtue signalling, even before the investigation, with no facts at all. It's trending on twitter"
"Fuck i hope this goes viral and becomes headline news. This shits got to end, there needs to be more consequences for creating false accusations and crime."
"It made headlines even in International media, even financial news reporting sites were tooting their horns. Some were even justifying boy's suicide which resulted from this. No noise after the investigation outed the girl. She was given girl pass by police for being a minor and said the whole thing is a childish act."
"In fact in the eventuality of all this, a 17yr boy suicide and police arrested boys for for being in part of the group. Boys even avoided being part of all this. Police gave a free pass to the girl saying she is a minor."
We were actually studying somthing like this in school the where lower-class white women in the south would make false accusations of sexual assult by African American men

Hand it over. Now
I attempted to do the funnies and make an incel comic
I am confused. Are they on a date? Or is she at a different table and he sent her a drink?
I think the latter. He feels she owes him sex because he sent her a drink (unsolicited to boot).
"That is what I am thinking as well, but, while its a well made comic it is in no way clear."
I'm confused
What the fuck is happening in this
I think I get it. A woman and an incel are at a restaurant at two different tables then she orders wine. The incel ask to get the same type and she looks at him. He gets all flustered and is on like Twitter or something. She then leaves and then the we get to the last panel.
I think I cracked the code. The incel is at dinner and sees a beautiful woman. He asks the waiter to send her a glass of wine. The woman accepts the glass of wine and at the end of her meal she leaves without offering herself to him. Hes mad and chases after her and demands sex in return for the wine he bought her.
This is not that hard to understand guys
"Female student Loses marks in essay specifically for using the word ""mankind"" because it is sexist according to her feminist professor Dr Anne Scott - This is how pervasive feminism is in university. Why would not say education has become feminised?"

"Oh, no, my dear, this is widespread now."
My architectural history professor did the exact same. Mankind was her example of words she deemed sexist.
"With such people making such remarks, it is always interesting to ask then why, if such words are so critically important that they denote sexism (which is so incredibly linguistically illiterate it's astounding), is their movement named after women, which clearly must also be a sign of sexism, and everything they fight against, from patriarchy to manspreading, manterupting and toxic masculinity, is named after men. Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way ""mankind"" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls? Of course all of it is neglecting the fact that the ""man"" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (""main"" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as ""wereman"" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as ""wyfman"". It can be argued that the disparition of the ""were"" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the ""hand"", the ""man"" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman). To argue that the ""man"" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about"" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. It is as incredibly stupid as ""we call it history because it is his story"", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where ""his"" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word ""story"" actually comes from a deformation of ""history"" than the other way around. Feminism never cease to amaze."

"How to stop feeling bad about dumping a girl?I suppose its a better problem than having no girls at all but every time I dump a girl I feel like shit for 3-4 days. Just yesterday, I dumped a nice girl who has moved away for 6 months. Jesus do I feel bad right now. She started crying, hyperventilating and talking about how this is going to drive her into depression. I feel super bad to inflict this on another human being, especially as she was actually a super sweet girl, she had just moved away."

Because you were the one who executed it for a reason?

"I think I might have just accidentally swallowed the wrong pill.This is a WALL. But getting this off my chest feels good so I'm gonna leave it that way. TLDR I'm respected more for not placating my common law wife. How can I do sweet romantic things that she lives for and not get re-wrapped up in a cycle of false compromise? &#x200B; So just a funny story. Been going through some stuff lately with all this extra face time with my partner. For the last 11 years we have been in a battle of wits because ever since taking a few classes on human sexuality in college I came to the conclusion that ""I don't want to have sex with just one person for the rest of my life"" and ever since we have just been at odds, every argument devolving into ""well if you just want other women then go"" and I would swallow my pride and try and make things up as best I could. Don't really regret any of this but in retrospect I was just hurting myself my not just ""doing what I want"" and letting the chips fall where they may. I stifled my education, felt no motivation to acquire wealth or solidify friendships. It all kept coming back to this futility between what I want and what I am ""supposed"" to want. All I wanted was to do this in the ""best"" way for both of us, wanted to be as honest as possible, and wanted to ultimately fill our life with love and social connection. She wouldn't even accept that I wanted those things, It had to be about her vulnerability in life, and everything I was saying/doing was just a means to get away and marry some other girl.... And my play was to waste my entire 20's on this?!? Fast forward to the vids-19 and I simply couldn't keep pretending like this wasn't ruining my life. Basically a ""I love you, but I now realize that if I don't do this for myself then I won't respect myself as a man, or even as a father, and I don't want to bring crippled life into this world."" Didn't even have to say ""I'm going do it or I'm going to leave"" or any truly shitty ultimatum, just simply ""I am going to be doing this, and I respect you're decision to do what you will with that information. Boom. Instant ""I want you to be happy, I know you really care about me etc. etc. etc. we can make this work."" Where was this the last 10 years when I was trying to compromise and do things without being a dick? Why is this here now? So off we go, she tells me ""I'd like to be a part of this journey with you, if you're patient with me I WANT to come along."" Go on a dating app for ethical non mono's, find a beautiful woman (whose partner wasn't a total goob) who was keenly interested in dating. All lights are green, I'm communicating with both of them and we are jiving well, I'm feeling... Good. I start exercising more, cut crap out of my diet. It was easy! I had reason! I WANTED to be attractive again. And it felt... Great. Like a literal cloud had lifted from my vision and I could taste the vigor and optimism I had in my early 20s before it was chipped away. I started answering calls, I ""forgot"" to smoke weed from sunrise to sunset. So many things in life just started falling back into place. When the time comes and we start a group text, everyone is talking and jiving, but I realize that my partner has only said one thing, and it's starting to feel awkward all around. When I ask her if she is having a hard time opening up, or if there is a reason she doesn't feel comfortable participating in the conversation she says... her fingers hurt too much.... Your fingers hurt?!?!? I excuse myself for a moment to try and smooth over my bubbling anger and take the time to think of the words to express my frustration, less than 3 or 4 minutes literally just took a piss. I come back and she is sleeping on the couch. I become livid, absolutely livid (I have also been having to deal with the unemployment office on a daily basis which is incompetent as hell so my patience as a whole is way less than usual.) I tell myself I am going to have a glass of wine... literally black out after the first few sips and wake up with half a 6 pack and a pack of cigarettes with 4 missing. I was devastated, I had worked so hard to quit smoking, and had gotten my drinking under control years ago and I allowed myself to be crushed by petty squabble. Long story short every micro step of the way she was sabotaging me, changing the rules of engagement. Generally running diversion as a means of delaying the inevitable. Fast forward to today. In general we do our best to keep our good time ""good."" So we decide to pack a lunch and take a short 5 or so mile hike through the woods and have great conversation about our family, life goals, what we would want for our children. Just general good stuff that you look for in a good relationship. Get home, and try and tactfully inquire about some sexy time. She says something along the lines of ""its hard for me to feel sexy when your talking to other women."" so I take that for what it is, wait a while and eventually just rub one out. Not a huge deal, I've been taking care of myself for years now. Some time later she comes up as I'm working on some Spanish lessons, asks me if I emailed her the recipe for this pizza dough I've been working on for the last 3 weeks (she knows I already did, she had it pulled up on her phone and I could see it!) I tell her that I'm pretty sure it's in her hand right now, she asks if I want to help her make it... Nah not what I'm ""wanting"" right now. She tells me she doesn't know how to use the kitchen scale... So I go and show her and carry on about my day. Comes back up as I'm finishing my last lesson and asks, again, if I ""want"" to go pick up some cheese from the store for her... You know what, sure, I could use the air and stroll and I do love you after all. I pop into the store, and grab 2 things instinctively. The cheese, and her favorite flowers. As I'm walking back up the driveway the heavy shit hits... If I'm buying her these flowers because I want sex I'm just fucking myself over. I'm literally rewarding her for playing hard to get and trying to stifle my upward momentum. And out of my mouth with glee, almost as if they weren't my own words I say. ""Theses are my flowers!"" I come in hand her the cheese with flowers in hand. She is beaming, eyes welling up. ""Why did you get me flowers?"" I tell her I didn't, and that I got them because I just wanted them. I ask her, ""where do we keep the vases again?"" Plop that vase right in my officer and carry on with my day. She literally won't stop BEGGING to give me sexual attention. But I'm good just wanked! This is CRAZY. But it doesn't feel anymore crazy than what I was doing before placating her every-move. Any tips to not ride this train off a cliff? I feel like I can still feel this way, and be sweet and loving and romantic, but right now I'm getting more positive attention being an asshole. I never wanted to believe that the whole ""assholes"" get girls thing was even real in any sense. Can I just like convey this to her somehow or am I best off maxing out on this new found mentality. Yeeehaw!"
Ur about to get ruined here lol

"How to move on and let go?Basically I'm asking for advice on how to move on and let go of this girl who has been tormenting me in my own head. She lived next door and we quickly became friends as we had a lot in common. At the time I was very bad with girls and had no experience. I quickly developed a crush on her but had no idea to make a move. She would often flirt with me when drunk but I was oblivious and shy at the time. Fast forward I grew some balls and started talking to girls and getting with women. This led to me and her eventually hooking up. However she quickly started displaying weird behavior. She would flirt with me all night and then leave with another guy, was constantly hot and cold I thought I was buggin but her friends agreed that this was a habit of hers. I became upset with her and my neediness caused her to end things but I found out that she had lied to me about something else and ended our friendship. She begged me for forgiveness and so I forgave her. The year after we start hooking up again but one night while we're walking home she ditches me and sleeps with my best friend who had a gf. He knew I liked and even bragged about lying to her and how bad she wanted him to me and other friends. Im beyond upset and tormented. Firstly that she would sleep with a guy like that, I usually couldn't care who she sleeps with, not that she even needs my permission but it just makes it ten times worse to think that she would sleep with a guy like that. (fast forward he did something similar to another friend months later but they were actually about to date the girl.) . Obviously this is more of a me problem why does it bother me so much that she'd sleep with a guy like this. I mean I'd understand like if the guy was actually charming but he wasn't good looking, was narcissistic and a compulsive liar. When I asked her about it she said she was really drunk and him as well, which checks out. But idk if she was drunk enough that she didn't know what she was doing. An important part of this story is we never had sex we would always get close but she always claimed she'd feel bad bc her best friend had a huge crush on me and told her not to. Which was true. I think this made it all the more worse as he got something so easily that I had been trying so hard for. But she also had a string of toxic behavior that made me question if this was the real reasoning or if she was just manipulating me, for validation.(I could never tell although she did seem sincere when she said she did want to sleep with me). Logically I know this girl and friend aren't for me and I should move on from both but their both stuck in my head, its been many months now and time isn't helping. I constantly think about the two of them together. And for some strange reason I still want her, no girl has come close. I've had sex with a few more girls since but nothing is filling the gap. I want her out of my head sorry for any grammatical errors and if it seemed like I was jumping around I left out a lot of events to try and get to the point faster."
"Well I didn't fully read your post before commenting. Having read the last part, all I can say is as humans we always want what we can't have. You're never going to get with her again because you've shown her that you long for her attention. You just need to convince yourself of this. It would probably be tough since we're on quarantine but the last time I was in such a situation, I went on holiday to clear my head and it worked wonders. If you have some male friends spend more time with them. Just do exciting stuff man and most importantly, KNOW that that chick is history for you."
The Coronavirus Is a Disaster for Feminism
"I'll say it again, I don't think trying to divide household labour into 50/50 divisions with a tit for tat approach is useful. Household work should be communicated and divided based on skill, enjoyment, time, etc....not arbitrary ""equality."" That way you don't build resentment, especially between genders in a relationship."
The title does not cover the contents. I think it would be better to say that the pandemic affects men and women in distinctly different ways. And these deserve to be looked at in their own right. I don't see how the pandemic affects feminism as an ideology.
>I don't see how the pandemic affects feminism as an ideology. It reminds us that we have real issues to address.
That's pretty much expected to happen when you stake the ideology on a couple of misleading statistics.
Imagine an adult man that isnt the father kissing a girl like that. He would get fucking sued
Society just wants to think that all men are bad and have ill intentions

"I'm not sure which is more interesting, the reported division of domestic labor, or the fact that women's poll results are seen as fact, while men's are seen as simply disagreeing."
"Why not both? Anecdata time, to illustrate the issues I see with this sort of surveys (also, the article supports their claims based on data from surveys for the most part, while at the same time linking to a paper that criticizes data from surveys as being misleading...) Since the COVID-19 thing started, I've been confined with my parents at their house, and my father is still working (fortunately he can do so with his computer), so he wakes up at 7am in the morning and takes the dogs for a walk (if possible) while I prepare breakfast for the two of us (my mother usually wakes up at 9am the earliest). He also takes care of buying and/or preparing the firewood to keep the house warm (not needed as much since 1-2 weeks ago, and I too do my part in this, but you get the idea), keeps the garden in a good state, and fixes most if not all things related to electronics or informatics in the house (so the computers and associated software that allow the three of us to still work from home, the air conditioner...). He's also responsible for the maintenance for both of their cars, buying the food (and medicines, sanitizers... Everything that needs buying, he is responsible to get, basically) and storing it in the fridge(s) in an organized way, after the three of us decide what we'll be having for lunch/dinner the next 1-2 weeks (he then makes a plan to *when* we'll be having dish to keep the diet somewhat varied and avoid having to cook too much some days, and not at all others, and to avoid over-filling the fridges). On the other hand, my mother keeps the inside of the house (but nothing else) clean and prepares lunch once every two days (my father does so the other day), while either any of them or I prepare dinner (depending on who is ""more available for the task""). With the questions presented by the survey, if the article you linked is nything to go by, I would say that in this case my mother would end up being the one my mother would me most of the ""home-schooling"" (if there were any kids), even though my father would be helping a lot by taking work off her shoulders (the time he spends shopping, taking the dogs for a walk, and preparing/fixing all devices that allow the rest of us to do our work comfortably, is time saved up for the rest of us, including for my mother, who could spend it ""home-schooling""). In a similar way, the question: > Who is currently most responsible for housework, such as cooking and cleaning? Would be answered such that my father would be doing at the very least as much, if not more, of the housework, if you look only at the part before the colon. However, he technically does less than half of the cooking and cleaning, which may explain discrepancies in their answers. So, basically, most of it comes down to how you ask the questions and how you present the results, in terms of the conclussions they extract. And it comes down to how each couple/family organizes themselves. I got tons of help from both of my parents when I was younger, and would find it insulting if anyone tried to minimize the work **both of them** did that allowed me to (for example) study at the university, be succesfull in getting a degree, then a master, and later on a PhD and a career. They each did their best and helped tons, in different ways, by talking about how to organize themselves, and playing their own roles within those plans. This sort of surveys sometimes seem to be looking for specific answers, by looking at how the questions are formulated, and then these answers are usually extrapolated to cover much more than the questions allow to. Thus the way the reports are made, both in terms of the answers themselves and how they are interpreted."
"> Who is currently most responsible for housework, such as cooking and cleaning? Also, ""responsible for"" in this context is ambiguous and potentially subjective. If I usually take out the trash, but only after my partner asks me to do so... who is ""responsible for"" the trash going out? If one person sets the standards for how housework should be done, and initiates when it should be done, one could say that person is ""most responsible"" even if the other partner spends more time and effort doing it."
Yeah. My guess is that the true number is somewhere in between - say 25% of the time men do more of the home-schooling.

Or the social aspect of fathers over-reporting their involvement to look better.
Why are you assuming it's fathers overreporting and not mothers underreporting?
I'm not really. The above user is definitely assuming that though.
Overreporting seems to be the name of the game when it comes to surveys that question how much work anyone has done in an environment of shared work. The work we've done ourselves feels much more salient than the work someone else has done.
How to be a man - The art of manliness book summary by Brett McKay
Somebody recommend this book here
This made me cringe pretty hard.
why?
At the end you will be a manly man like cmon. It sounds like it was narrated by someone who is having a hard time following their own advice.
Ah. I didn't make it to the end.
why am I getting MGTOW vibes here Edit: btw thats not a good thing
"Can't speak to the book or the video, but Brett's podcast and website helped me learn about some cool stuff. Definitely not MGTOW..."
"MGTOW? Big fan of the podcast too. Lots of cool, informative topics and guests are covered."
"Men Go Their Own Way. An incredibly controversial and arguably deeply mysogynistic(sp??) ... Maybe you'd call it a life strategy, with a big focus being interactions with women."
"Fwbs - Unsure if she's pulling back...confused on what to do?I'm unsure if she's consciously pulling back, she's lost interest, or she's just comfortable....but something has changed. I've been seeing my female colleague Fwbs for the last 6/7 months. She initiated the whole thing and we called each other our 'distractions'. Sex started out as once a week, which gradually increased overtime. In Feb, she told me we may have to stop as she's starting to feel attached. I think this was to gage my reaction and interest level. Up until then, I held my emotions close to my chest and always let her bring up the flirtiness and 'emotions' first - she would often message saying she would like a cuddle or whatever and then apologise for ""needines"" saying as ""there's no place for it"". I always reciprocated to the same level and energy. Then in March, I started to compliment her more and tell her how much she turned me on etc. At the start she told me she was very needy and insecure - and believe it or not, but these compliments and reassurances did wonders for our 'relationship' - we were having sex nearly everyday. We ended up staying a night in a hotel through work - the day after, she was telling me how much she liked it and that it made her feel like she wanted more. She then wrote me a long message about how attracted she was physically/sexually and started it off by saying ""some things are best left unsaid"" - I asked her but she refused to tell me. At this point, it was her doing most of the chasing - I was just sitting back and letting things happen. Then lockdown happened. We have a bit of freedom so can see each other occasionally. For the first few weeks, she would come over a couple times a week, however, I would always have to ask her (I've always done it, I think she feels too vulnerable in making plans for sex) as she would never invite herself round. She was still being flirty by message, saying she wished she had more time etc. to come round. Then, 3 weeks ago, I asked her round and she said she couldnt but ""would honestly love to see me. Maybe tomorrow?"". I said ""yes, providing you can get here by xx as my roommate will be in"". She replied ""I will see. You can always meet me for one of your walks on the weekend"". I said ""my roommate normally comes with me so we'll have to see"". She then had a slight outburst and said ""you told me you normally walk alone, good to know I won't have to go out my way"". I replied ""he does on the weekend but not in the week"". Anyway, she said that was ""nice we do that"" and then messaging continued in a normal chit chatty vibe. I will admit, I did tell her I walked alone everynight a few days before and I only said my roommate comes with me on the weekend to lash out in response to her saying no - she's always so flakey and I felt like she asked me about 'going for a walk' as I didn't reciprocate her saying ""she would love to see me"". From that point however, she has taken a lot of emotion and flirtiness out of her messages. We've met 3 times since, once for sex and I can still feel her physical attraction is strong. But her messages have been quite dry. I will also say that she does continue to message me first everyday (always, always messages me first) until we say goodnight, but it's mainly chit chat and about work stuff. She seems to deflect any flirtiness and doesn't initiate any emotions anymore. I like her a lot and want more but it's difficult as we work in a very small team, and neither of us wants to be rejected. I just find it odd that up until the whole walking conversation, she told me a few days prior that she was missing me, and that seeing me once a week wasn't nearly enough. Then a few days after the convo, we met up and she said to me ""little every so often is nice though, at least it's something"". I mean, seriously? Another interesting point, is that nearly a week prior to the walking convo, we had sex and she messaged afterwards. It seemed like she was 'teeing' me up to be emotional towards her first but I didn't. Nothing obvious but my gut told me by her messages that what she was doing. And when I didn't, it's like she tried to play it cool after. I want to ask her if she's okay but it's been a while and I wanted to see if she would come around and be more open but she hasn't. I also don't want to ask her as it will make her feel vulnerable and she will likely deny it anyway. I'm also cautious that perhaps I've overpursued her and she's losing interest and backing off slowly. Is it best to just play it cool, give her space and let her come to me more, or just tell her ""I think I upset you?"". I wonder if she's slowing things down to keep her emotions in check - perhaps she realised we were getting carried away? I just don't want to blow it by coming across as needy and seeking validation when there's nothing concrete to present back to her..."
"I skimmed this. Girls dont last forever without commitment; even if shes not looking for it. It sounds to me like you care a bit too much for the situation - you shouldnt be even thinking this if it was a true fwb for you. Think about what you want out of this. If its just sex/minor companionship, try to set something up that gets you back to that. Understand that she could just be talking to a new guy, or bored of the situation."
Maybe...but she was so hot up until the walking conversation...then she's changed. Maybe she thinks I'm just not that into her
"If theres one thing Ive learned with women, 90% of the time if you just chill, she will come back around."
Thanks. Just gotta play it cool
Do the most counter-intuitive thing in the world [Make Yourself The Priority](https://youtu.be/s4EaB1opT7g). Gets her coming back around and chasing you every time.
"So you think asking her about it is a bad idea. Like saying ""I sense that I've upset you a couple of times.? I don't think that's needy, no?"
"If she wants to talk about it, she will bring it up. You work with her right? You should be careful about this situation"
As a FWB there are 2 situations in how itll end: 1:shes either gonna grow attached and wana date or 2: you're riding your time with her until she dates someone else/gets bored of you.
"Well, she's already told me she was getting attached back in March. She's cooling things off from her side a bit - I just can't workout why."
"MasturbatingAlright so Im trying to not masturbate for extended periods of time. The problem is that after 5 days, Im too horny, cant focus for shit. So I masturbate, and then Im depressed and dont even want to game girls anymore. What should I do to get out of this loop?"
"Perhaps once you understand the destruction youre causing yourself. Every time you break that promise to yourself, youre reinforcing in your subconscious mind that youre a little bitch who doesnt keep his word. You cant run from your own memory bro"
Masturbate once a week without porn until you can get a girl
"yup, testosterone hits its peak after 7 days of not busting."
So anything more than 7 days is a waste and does nothing for testosterone at all?
"Depends on your body and other habits. I either have to bust every day or lift. Otherwise I can't sleep and start to rage. Lifting is better. Instead of trying to fuck everything I just start getting shit done like a maniac when I don't bust and ALSO lift. Lifting is like breathing, life ends without it."
"You're doing much better than most. A good chunk of men masturbate every single day sometimes more. You have to understand that it's EXCESSIVE masturbation that will really destroy you and that semen retention is HARD and requires great discipline. Yeah man, Somewhere about close to a week of no masturbation you gain a massive spike in testosterone that definitely explains the strong urges. You have to challenge yourself to fight that motherfucker . Go for a walk, do some pushups, go look for something you lost, you can even gather trash in the house and take it out. ANYTHING to get your mind off of it. Keeping adding one extra day after those 5 days. ""I already did 5 days, I can definitely do one more"" ""Damn It's almost been a week, I'm going to go until Monday"" You actually have to work with yourself on this. - Set goals - Understand/identify urges - Expend any and all triggers - Find and repeat tasks that take your mind off of it"
"The first two weeks of nofap are the hardest. Pun not intended. &#x200B; Once you make it past week two, even without any sex, as long as you stay away from porn you're gonna be fine."
No fap is fucking stupid. NoPorn is all you need. Stop masturbating to porn and you automatically stop masturbating so frequently. Porn also trains your brain to be a cuck. Yer sitting there masturbating watching some other dude fuck a chick. No porn. No problem (with masturbating).

"Realized I am a beta orbiter.Yes i know, gaming girls online is not the best thing to do, and i agree 100% but during this covid lockdown i'd like to get some P. (I do lift, arranged a home gym). So i dm'd this chick i've been following. She replied, and we chatted a bit. And in couple of minutes i realized i sound like a beta orbiter. She: I like getting myself some croissants and coffee early in the morning, that's like my little thing. Me: That's great, those little things make our days perfect. She: Yes they definitely do. <3 Me: What else do you like to lighten your day up with? And that's the moment i felt that i sound like a beta orbiter. Can anyone share any advice how to make convo more sexually oriented via text messaging?"
"Woah cowboy, you've literally only just started texting her. You're not a beta orbiter yet - that phrase kinda implies it's been going on for ages. Cut yourself some slack, bud. What's your plan - to actually meet her and bang? Or are you just looking to talk dirty for a bit online only? You haven't mentioned your actual goal."

The Growing Backlash to Womens Only Programs
"A couple of responses, then a larger thought. >Feminists dont agree on every point regarding gender disparities. Pasquerella, for example, is not troubled by the lopsided overrepresentation of women in nursing, she said, because there is no evidence men face stigma or discrimination in that field. I find that hard to believe. I mean, it's anecdotal to be sure, but I have friends and relatives that have gone through nursing programs, and this wasn't their experience at all. It was actually akin to the worst stories that you hear about women in other courses. > A paper she co-authored for publication this year -- Choice of Majors: Are Women Really Different From Men? -- reports that girls respond to a variety of influences and are more likely than boys to change majors when they get poor grades in STEM classes. Ironically, female-only programs may diminish their interest and confidence. Truth is, this is a culture that I think really stands out of if you look at it, and there might be something there there, in certain STEM courses. ""C's get degrees"". ""What do you call a doctor that barely passed their tests. Doctor"" and so on. I actually think there's something to be explored here, and that this might be where there's a very real socialization gap. The problem is it's not sexy to talk about. Girls and Women tend to place a higher intrinsic value on grades. And then changing it....again, not something we're comfortable talking about. My position is clear...I believe that these barriers exist far less in different environments. It's why I encourage things like commuter schools and online learning. If discrimination is a problem...IMO these are the things we can best do to directly address it. But that stuff is probably off the table. But I think this sort of results-driven hammering? I don't think it's sustainable, for that very reason. It's too self-contradictory. Unless we're going to straight up say OK, things are going to be draconian until we get to statistical equality, deal with it....but even then, honestly, that's just going to create fights over who gets to be the target of said draconian measures. Who gets set on fire to keep other people warm?"
"Part of the problem here is I dont think we will ever achieve statistical equality with those in power currently there. The problem is that there is a lot of people in the field of gender equality which are only and exclusively advocates for women. You can see how begrudging some of these schools were to allow men (into programs named for girls) simply so they could continue their agenda. The problem is the mindset and goal is wrong. We cant even evaluate statistical inequality without looking at other things such as women making up 60 percent of degrees in masters programs. Just to point out how big that difference is and there is no school addressing it. Also, I agree that STEM gives out harsher grades and there might be some difference either social or biological that causes that to affect women more. It could be because of inflated grades given for other subjects or if one sex is used to failiure more often that they perform better when failiure is a higher risk. However, we cant get to that conversation because people are trying to balance out percentages, but only ones they feel are discriminatory or that affect women. These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly."
"> Part of the problem here is I dont think we will ever achieve statistical equality with those in power currently there. Yeah...that's probably a big part of the issue. Especially when those in power game up with said out-of-date theories, and have a vested interest in maintaining them. >These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly. I used the wrong word for draconian. I didn't mean harsh per se...I meant one sided. What I meant was we're just going to say, all these programs are just going to be help women. Full stop. They do not apply to men. Just put all the cards on the table. The problem is that's not politically viable, I think. It just breaks a basic sense of fairness that I do think is dominant still. As well...I think it just makes the costs too evident. It's not some vague goal...it becomes...yeah...your son has to sacrifice to get the numbers right. Sorry, he has to give up on his dreams. I'm sure you'll make him understand that it's for the greater good. I think that's why it's not sustainable. That's the other side of the pendulum. We're stuck between a relatively vague commitment to ""equality"", which won't last under scrutiny at a systems/process level, and this other point of not wanting to be thrown under the bus/throw our loved ones under the bus, for the greater good of equality."
"So, is the solution to allow sex-based groups so long as the excluded gender is allowed to start their own group if they like, or to make all sex-based groups illegal and all groups/schoalrships/University class must be 50/50?"
"Are we asking about Title IX again? Under Title IX, there has to be equal programs with equal funding by the university for all sex exclusive clubs, programs, activities. Its not enough that the university just allow one to be created. If they find it, it has to have matched funding. Same with promotion. Welcome to football massive revenue and rules meant to prevent schools from spending all their money on stadiums for football teams while not even having a volleyball area for this. To me the solution is not about equal numbers at all. However thats the rationale behind STEM programs so its useful to criticize other percentages based on that. Optimally to me equality of oppurtunity would open doors to stem fields without closing any on anybody.....which includes men wanting to learn STEM in a greater proportion then women as is their choice. The problem is that I find their partial solution draconian and they find my solution discriminatory because there is disproportionate interest. This all comes from us having different views on biology of men and women."
"Yes, if the University funds it then I think they should have to fund both *if it is wanted or needed* and not just a tit and tat response. I don't agree about private donations, or scholarships by private individuals. I also think some groups will do more fundraising and will always have more resources because of it, which is also fine. >Optimally to me equality of oppurtunity would open doors to stem fields without closing any on anybody But class sized are finite. You can't have hundreds or thousands in a single class, so there needs to be some measure of who gets in. That seems to be the complicated part- deciding on and agreeing on those metrics. Is your position that if a school buys the mens team $5000 worth of basketball uniforms, they have to also buy $5000 worth of basketball uniforms for the womens team as well, or give them $5000 to spend as they like?"
"Sure but realize how much money was raised by football teams that they could hire coaches and pay them 10 mil and still have 150 million left a year.... Mens basketball is also typically a revenue generator. Would it be fair to have the mens team get advertised and have new uniforms and get TV deals when the womens team could not facilitate any of those? Enter Title IX, school now has to provide similar offerings for mens and womens teams. I guess what I am trying to say is if what you said was the standard of fair then we have decades of discrimination against male athletes. Men got the short end of the deal for a long time but now that the shoe is on the other foot and men would get the benefit of this legislation, now it is suddenly a problem! Equality cannot be redistributive only when you want to when Title IX is a redistributive piece of legislation that it is based on. If we did sports scholarships by demand/popularity, we would see more male scholarships. Would that be fair? If you disagree with Title IX, then do you disagree with its redisbrutive effects on men over time as being unfair or unequal?"
">If you disagree with Title IX, then do you disagree with its redisbrutive effects on men over time as being unfair or unequal? I don't understand the inner workings of Title IX or the American University culture enough to definitively say either way. That's why I'm on record repeatedly saying tit for tat is an absurd approach. Either people decide they want utter equality (sports teams getting the exact same amount regardless of the revenue they generate, or you allow funding to be based on need, popularity, merit, personal interest, and then you have times when men or women don't get what the other group does. Either we want firm and absolute equality even when it's silly, over-reaching and imo, dystopian, or we learn to live in a world where the give and take of all resources is flexible."
"I agree with you but let me lay out the problem as I see it: The problem is popular advocacy wants the best of both of these worlds frequently. Oh this is a situation where men are outperforming without involvement? Lets redistribute the success! Equality of outcome! Oh this is a situation where women are outperforming men? Well hands off! Freedom to choose! Freedom of association etc! The issue I have is when you are here defending things with freedom of choice and another person defends stuff with equality of outcome . Sometimes both are used by people who only care about womens interest and they either dont understand or act maliciously about how its discriminatory against men. I would select equality of oppurtunity by the way. I am actually against Title IX existing, but that means I would want everything it affects including sports to be undone. I would like everything judged by that same standard. The problem is we have lots of areas where we have redistributive policies which benefit women and areas where women have more rights and/or outperform that should arguably be distributed. Some examples of redistributive equality policies that benefit women or tend to benefit more women: quotas, child support, Alimony, sports payment/scholarships, marriage/divorce laws, female only programs, gym hours. Some examples where women have an arguably better deal out of it without any other intervening policy: child custody, paternity laws, womens scholarships, draft, #believewomen, dating, power of sex appeal, FGM/MGM, spending gap You can also list some redistributed policies that favor men (bathroom lines based on same size bathrooms in public) You can also add non redistributed policies that people argue should be redistributed (Pay Gap, job career choices gap) I could add more things to all 4 of these areas. The point is that it is common to see freedom of choice arguements made alongside redistributive ones. (See advocacy for my body my choice and compare it to wage gap). However I look at all these issues and notice that redistributive equality and equality of oppurtunity get men shafted on both ends of it currently, frequently. I see current advocacy as using both standards, combined. This is no longer equality but a way to use equality as an arguement of convenience to argue for something above equality. So, when I argue Title IX, its not because I believe Title IX is the best thing ever, but because I am pointing out the lopsided tendency of advocacy that argues BOTH Outcome and Oppurtunity...picking whichever arguement is convient. The goal should be to pick one standard and work towards it. Instead we have the bastardization or arguing as advocacy for women by any standard that can possibly be used to support the arguement. This is why I consider my flair to be the most important thing for advocacy in general. I am not anti woman or pro man.. I am advocating for a consistent standard."

Hello are there any resources to learn seductionI mean I want to learn how to make a man happy. Please him. Are there any resources? Well thank you for the gold
A book titled the Art of Seduction by Robert Green - good start xx
The best book so far. It works like a charm.
"Sexually? Show him genuine enthusiasm to have sex with him (don't fake it, they know when you're not thrilled). If it's your thing, learn how to give a really good blowjob. Hint: don't use teeth. Participate in sex, don't just lay there and moan as necessary until he goes. Also, don't fake orgasms. He will think he's doing it right so he'll keep doing it which will lead to sexual frustration. Most men like a little life? from their partner. If you're not enjoying it, they're most likely not enjoying it. Generally? Also, a cold beer (or his favorite beverage) and 15 minutes of silence when he comes home from work. It sounds antiquated but my guy loves this part. He works about an hour commute from home so he's stressed from work and then a crazy long drive. I try to have a cold beer or drink for him on his desk when he gets home and just 15 minutes of peace and quiet to decompress. I just let him do his thing. ""Hi babe! How was your day?"" ""it was xxxxx"" and then I leave it at that. He'll come to me when he's chilled out a bit. Most importantly ASK HIM WHAT HE LIKES. You're not a mind reader. What seduces guy a might not seduce guy b. Just ask what he likes. If you want to make him happy, ask what makes him happy."
Excellent post!
Kama Sutra?
"What exactly do you find to be wrong with Kama Sutra? Are you afraid of sexuality? It IS part of maleness AND femaleness AND (bonus point) them BOTH together (that, often forgotten about, 3rd party in a couple), would you disagree?"
The Kamasutra is not about sex. It is a text explaining every single aspect of family-life in society. Its about 300 pages long and MAYBE 30 pages are about sex? Its actually a goldmine for how to exist in harmony with your husband and family.
"The old joke is that the answer to how to make a man happy is get naked, bring beer. Add steak or burgers to that."
"True seduction starts in the kitchen. Care for him, make sure he's well fed. After that, bedroom time :)"
"Is it a normal occurrence for women, for your male friends to suddenly suggest having sex?Is it a normal thing for a guy you thought was your friend to demand/suggest sex? Its happened three times now and some have demanded others have suggested that it would be a good idea? What is up with that?!? I always block and cut them off after like wtf? Edit: I always keep things super friendly but cant see myself at all creating any sort of I fancy you vibes towards these guys?"
Why would it be a good idea? What was the reasoning? Definetly not normal and it's the right move to cut them out asap It essentially shows that they were only your friend so you would f them. And afterwards they cry about being friendzoned
"One guy just to have sex its no big deal and the other thinks because Ive been single for over a year (and very happy I may add! ) that we should have sex because it would just be a good idea as I have no one to have sex with and he really wants to have sex with me. Others just say well youre really attractive so why not? And none of these benefit me in any way? They just think I must be begging for it after a year?? When I turned them down, like you said, they got pissy and mad. Makes me mad they think Im that easy. Im generally labelled as a feisty individual so it makes me mad to get treated this way."
"He's not your friend. This is one of the reasons male/female relationships often don't work, because one or both of them have secret desires to be more than friends. Stop trying to have friendships with men. Sorry, but there's a reason people recommend against it."
"Beginning to give up on men all together, dating & friends"
"Dating is different - you're being honest about what you want, and hopefully he is too! Why do you want to give up on dating?"
Its just never gone well for me. Normally Im a really positive person and try to see the best in every situation but dating/boyfriends has never gone well and I dont feel like that will change. I feel like all men are like that
"well I gotta say tommy, i'm shocked, just shocked. I never thought that something like this would happen. We're in the 21st century for pete's sakes."
"Some male/female friendships can work. But its because a line has been drawn. Once someone passes that line, Im out. I have plenty of guy friends that dont hit on me. Why would I spend time with the one who keeps calling me beautiful? If they like you, they can ask you out. If they harass you cut contact."
Thank you. They 100% cut then line. Even when i make it clear Im not interested they have kept asking again and again.
"Falsifying: MisogynyAnother term that pops up a lot, it seems especially relevant to feminist characterization of patriarchal culture. Does anyone here believe that they can point to one or more cultures that are highly influenced by misogyny, and if so, how do we measure its existence, and its effects on society? Definitions are open to those that believe misogyny is a relevant and useful term. Again, primarily looking for quantification and statistical tests being implemented. But I'd love to see what other evidence is presented."
All of world history. Its full of misogynistic cultures.

There is a little write-up in the original comments. Allegedly she got in a physical fight with her boyfriend and he smashed her head into the door and broke a glass pane. She was arrested because she ignored police commands and attempted to get dressed when they told her to sit tight.

How is OPs statement stupid?

">intentionally drugging and robbing men multiple times There's literally zero evidence this ever happened, so no, he's not. He's comparing two ""off comments"" as you say."
You need an actual accuser to come forward with a robbery or rape allegation. Self admission isnt worth anything. She can always say I was just kidding for the street cred or something. Bill Cosby has several accusers.
>Who cares about a couple dudes who got drugged while committing a crime. I have no sympathy for them anyway. So by that logic you have no issue with people in jail for drug possession offenses? Since they were also committing a crime?

Only feminist Sources allowed
Not my post found it in r/tumblrinaction. I'm on mobile if someone can please link to original
The wage gap has been debunked so many times and if there really was a wage gap then companies would only hire women because the would do the same amount of work for less money. From what I hear most universities in the US are really SJW
Of it's the glass ceiling now. So now they are going to try to pass laws that all females must be promoted.
The reason you are wrong is because there are no sources that affirm my bias.
"Im going to guess your sister is at an American university or Canadian and if that is the case most of the teachers will typically be that left leaning way of thinking. Mainly because of what the left claims to offer or what their followers want with higher wages for everyone having minimum wage be something like $15 dollars. Also people who tend to be right leaning are typically male and female are left leaning typically, with the males they dont become teachers or caregivers in most cases leading to a majority female and a majority of teachers, profs, caregivers being left leaning. Along with the wage gap, there is a wage gap but for good reason. Men in the same job typically work longer hours, less vacation time, typically ask for raises compared to woman, along with many things employers like to see."
I would send this to the administration and simply ask what their attitude is to it.
Hey! You're not using biased sources that confirm my ideology!
"If you think it's too late to change (I'll prove you wrong)Someone posted the other day, *""With all this free information available on the internet, how come a bunch of people still struggle to get laid and improve themselves?""* I've noticed this myself - a huge number of people here (and in other self-improvement/dating communities) struggle with taking that first step and actually starting to work on themselves and fix their issues. It's easy to read everything on here, buy seduction books/courses, read 100 websites, watch other people hit on girls, feeling that rush of dopamine as you excitedly think, ""It's not that hard - I could do it too!"" But it's another thing to actually *do it yourself*. **Taking that first step is the hardest step you'll ever take.** Other guys feel like it's too late for them, or that they're ""far too fucked-up"" to ever have any hope of getting laid or finding a girlfriend or being in a happy relationship. They'll lurk on here (maybe even comment every now and then), reading everything that's posted, but they'll never in a billion years even consider for a second that they could be out there making progress themselves. They gave up hope years ago; after all, getting laid is something that's reserved for *other people*. I want to share my story, to show you no matter how much of a handicap you're starting with, no matter how screwed up your life or your mindset or your head may be - you can turn it all around. It won't be easy. It'll take a shitload of work - probably years. But it's very bloody doable. **I'll give the short version of my story:** I was extremely suicidal from age 14 to 23. As in, every single day Id have fantasies of killing myself. I lost count of the number of times I found myself in the kitchen holding a knife to my wrist, willing myself to have the courage to *finally fucking do it*. I was in 2 abusive relationships, had ZERO friends, and my life consisted of nothing that really made me happy. I didn't think any women would ever truly like me (my girlfriend at the time hated me, it was a pretty fucked up relationship - we just yelled and screamed at each other all the time). I had a job for a bit but I lost it, and that was when things *really* got bad. That job was really the only thing getting me out of the house, and once I no longer had it, I turned to alcohol. I became a raging alcoholic (was drunk basically 24/7), developed a severe porn addiction (most days watching 8hrs of porn) and spent the rest of the time playing video games. I developed really bad agoraphobia (fear of leaving the house) - I literally couldn't go outside to check the mail. I'd make excuses not to even go to the grocery store - I'd make my girlfriend buy all our groceries, which only made her hate me more. I hated my life, and I hated *myself* even more. I had no friends, no confidence, no reason for existing, nothing that made me smile. My family lived 5000km away so I didn't even have them. I was obviously depressed as hell about it all - like I said, I used to fantasise about the knives in the kitchen draw, or I'd be crossing the road and I'd see a truck coming and I'd think, ""If I just closed my eyes and stood here right now, it could all be over."" Worst of all I was completely hopeless - I was convinced there was **no way** I could ever change. I was stuck in this miserable existence and I'd always be unhappy. I told myself when I hit my 30th birthday, I was allowed to kill myself. Eventually I hit rock bottom when my girlfriend broke up with me, and my family found out how depressed/suicidal I'd been. I had to confess everything - the addictions, the alcoholism, the agoraphobia, the suicidal thoughts, how much I hated living. My parents were so fucking supportive - I moved back home to live with them for a year. They forced me to go see a counsellor, and forced me to start leaving the house. It was absolute *hell* at first, but I slowly got better at just being outside, then making friends, then working on my addictions. I lost weight (75lbs in total), started hitting the gym and lifting weights (went from not being able to do a single pushup/pullup/squat, to being able to deadlift 175kg). I found self-improvement websites and started getting my mind right, worked on actually *liking* myself, and started building a life I could be proud of. The last thing I had to fix was my dating life - and that was honestly the hardest thing ever. I went through an ""approach anxiety program"" (google ""Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program"" - it's free) and that was absolute HELL. You end up talking to 1500+ girls over the 6 weeks. But, by the end of it, I was confident enough to actually hit on girls properly and try to have sex with them (even though I was still terrified and shaking most of the time), and I actually started getting laid. I went on OkCupid/POF/Tinder/etc as well, and over time got really good at getting laid on there too. I've met some fucking *amazing* women over the years since then, including my current girlfriend of 2 years. She's the sweetest, coolest girl I've met - she adds a *hell* of a lot to my life. She's also bisexual so we've had a bunch of 3somes with other girls (about 12 from memory). Good fun. I never in a billion years thought I'd actually have any women truly *like* me for who I am - let alone have sex with me - let alone have 3somes and wild sex adventures a girlfriend who adores me. That stuff seemed so impossibly out-of-reach for me all those years ago; like a pipe dream I dare not even contemplate. Most importantly of all, I'm really fucking **happy** with my life. I haven't had a suicidal thought in years, I haven't been depressed in years - every fucking day feels like I've been given a gift and I'm so bloody grateful for it. I cover the rest of my transformation story here: [My Transformation.](https://killyourinnerloser.com/my-transformation/) Some before/after pics: &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/703e7sv0yix41.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e5602edcce4e5da6a29201e27ea041e896eb62b &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/i0gr2os1yix41.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=379b29502e1eeded6075fdd891fff3455f419037 &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/pfctrhf2yix41.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9948c746287d4dc09a2549c815f9c4733fdcb36d &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/txdrmhb3yix41.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6c68797a0a3a4e8ad22e4b1eb6af1329ca02c13 &#x200B; And [proof I get laid now](https://killyourinnerloser.com/proof/) (including pics/vids/stories). I hate the idea that anyone is sitting on here thinking they're a *lost cause*, that it's too late for them, that they're too far gone, that they'll never be able to change. I hate the idea anyone feels like their struggles are insurmountable. Trust me when I say this: **I am nothing special**. It doesn't take willpower (in fact, I have [very little discipline or willpower](https://killyourinnerloser.com/andy-discipline-willpower)). You just have to start working on your goals a little at a time - aim to just take *one tiny little baby step forward* every single day. Those tiny little steps add up over time, and before you know it, you'll be a long way ahead of where you started. If you're unhappy with your appearance - start losing fat/hit the gym. All you have to do is sign up for a gym membership, or go Google ""how to lose weight"". **That's one baby step you can take right now.** If you don't know how to talk to girls, go google ""Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program"". Just google it and read a bit of it. **That's one baby step you can take right now.** If you have no idea where to meet women, sign up for Tinder and just start talking to girls. I have a huge (free) Tinder guide on my site that covers literally every step from improving your looks, to taking pics, to messaging girls, going on dates, having sex, and even keeping them around for months/years afterwards. Seriously, just install Tinder and just start getting used to how the app works (you don't even have to message any girls yet) - **that's one baby step you can take right now.** If you're super depressed, google counsellors in your area. Or send a message to a mate, ""Hey man I gotta be honest, I've been feeling really bad lately."" Or send a text to a family member telling them you've been feeling down for a while. **That's one baby step you can take right now.** No matter where you're at right now, there is always *something* you can do. Some tiny little baby step you can take **right now**\*.\* Stop reading, stop sitting around watching other people find success, and stop thinking you aren't worthy. If I can do it, **you sure as hell can too.** \-Andy"

I'm 26 and i've had those exact same thoughts growing up. Am managing nutrition rn. How long did it take to get your squat up? How tall are you? How old are you now?
"I'm 32. I started most of the self-improvement stuff when I was about 24 until probably 26. Then I had a couple years where I was kinda just in ""cruise-control"" and a bit lazy. When I was 28 I started working on getting laid and hitting the gym. Took probably 2-3 years of hitting the gym (I'm naturally incredibly weak). I'm 6ft2 (In my experience the only reason people ask me my height is so they can say, ""Well I'm not that tall, so it's easy for him - therefore, I don't have to try."" Read [this](https://killyourinnerloser.com/youre-so-lucky/), then read [this](https://killyourinnerloser.com/i-cant-get-laid/#i-cant-get-laid-because-im-shortim-not-tall).) How are you going with nutrition? Got a plan, know what you're doing, etc? \-Andy"
"Hahah, guess i'll be prospecting 29 before I get to squat powers. I started losing weight when I was 16. Had anorexia at 18 ish and lost all my quadricep gains. Been doing calisthenics since but I have naturally low muscle tone so I've been hitting the gym as much as I can manage on a daily basis (which is not much) Idk about asking height. It feels crushing to know that i'll always be in the lowest percentile for height and have to work exponentially as hard to make up for it. That alone gives me depression sometimes, i guess i haven't worked up enough grit yet. Rn i'm on chicken breast and greens, lol. Trying to control carbs and stay consistent. I dropped 1kg in the last week and am getting used to tasteless chicken breast after 2 years of it so i think I'm getting somewhere"
"Yeah, if you're shorter you're definitely working with a handicap - but we all have handicaps. Mine was all the stuff I wrote above. You'll have to work harder, no doubt - but that doesn't mean you can't get laid. I do a bit of life coaching sometimes - two of my coaching clients are shorter dudes - one is 5'7, one 5'6. One was a virgin in his 30's when he first started seeing me; he's since gotten laid about 5 times now (over the course of a year). He absolutely had to work harder than a tall guy like me - and that's exactly what he did. No reason you can't do the same (even if you have to work fucking hard to get there - that'll just make your victory even more meaningful). Oh fuck man, that chicken breast and greens diet. I did that for a while but it killed me lol. If it drives you too insane and you can't stick to it - try other diets. A bunch of them work for weight loss (keto works best for me now, but I lost the \~75lbs by eating whatever the hell I wanted and just sticking to 1500 calories - that's called ""IIFYM dieting""). Gym - you seeing a trainer or a coach? I can't say that I ""earned"" my gym gains (I mean obviously I did the work) - 95% of the credit goes to my weightlifting coach though. I'm a lazy bastard so I literally just pay him to force me to workout - there's no way in hell I would have gotten strong without him. So many days I've said ""I don't really want to work out today, Dave. Can you yell at me and make me do it?"" and that's exactly what he does. Not saying a coach/trainer is mandatory - but they really do help if you've got some spare money. \-Andy"
I wanted to get a trainer back in december.. then covid happened
Now my question is is there anything like this more women centric?
"Not sure I get your question. As in, self-improvement for women to improve themselves? Or self-improvement for you to get more women?"
"Self improvement to improve themselves (I am a woman seeking men). But all I see is stuff like you a good the way you are and love yourself and I dont want to be the same, I want to improve, if that makes sense. All of the confidence & communication building (that Ive seen) focuses on men changing and women are perfect the way they are. I struggle being confident in talking to all people, not just when looking for a relationship or sex. Does that make sense?"
"Feminist Stance on Sex Robots / Robosexuality?Throwaway Account because I feel more comfortable this way. So we've experienced some pretty rapid evolution in robotics technology the past few years, to the point where sex robots are slowly becoming a reality, rather than just a bi-product of science-fiction. Being a robosexual myself, I've always wondered: What is the general consensus about sex robots or the attraction to robots in general in feminism? I've barely found articles discussing those topics in depth, let alone feminist ones. Feel free to ask for clarification if needed. &#x200B; EDIT: A question's been asked as to how one distinguishes robosexuality from objectophilia. It's cerainly a good question, so it's not gonna be that easy to answer. I can't speak for all robosexuals, but in the robosexual community I frequent the most, they generally enjoy the reveal of a human actually being a robot. Think of Terminator-like reveals where there is damage to the skin, showing that the person you thought you knew actually just a near-perfect replica of a human, designed to either blend in with or serve humanity. I've also heard the claims that a big part of robosexuality is objectification, specifically of women. While there's a sub-group in the robosexual community that enjoys the idea of being turned into a machine designed for sexual contact., consent plays a big part for most of these types of robosexuals. They want to be turned into a machine. (There's also a sub-group that enjoys forceful conversion of people into robots; I personally don't enjoy that, but who am I to kink-shame.) **A big part for many robosexuals isn't the objectification of the feminine/masculine, it's the feminization/masculinization of objects. Giving life to the impersonal of the modern era.** &#x200B; EDIT2: Many people mentioned consent, so I'll add a footnote here. Most people (there's always bad eggs trying to force people to roleplay or whatever, they are swiftly banned) in the robosexual community value consent highly. It's one of the big parts about the fetish even. **We don't find that robots just don't provide consent, it's more that robots always consent** because their sex-drive is infinite. At least until they run out of battery."
Theyre a sex object. They shouldnt look too human to give the impression its ok to objectify people.
People are capable of enjoying simulations without it warping their minds. Are you of the opinion that videogames that involve violence should deliberately hinder their graphics to make the characters seem less human lest it gives the impression it's ok to commit violence against people? Or should violent videogames simply not exist?
"I personally dont play those games with very human looking characters and real looking deaths because I really get effected by killing in them - I dont get aggressive, just disgusted. But thats a different subject. Theres a general understanding that killing is not ok. The same isnt true for objectifying women. Its already done in our society and I dont need another tool to do so"
"Would you rather these guys form romantic, loving bond with their sex robots before having sex with them? Are you against porn as well? What about sexual fantasies in general? Should men only ever be allowed to masturbate to thoughts of their own girlfriends and completely abstain from masturbation if they don't have one?"
"Shitposting, eh?"
I'm getting pretty tired of the things you think are sick burn gotcha arguments. Either participate in good faith or leave.
Ehhh its uncomfortable at best
"Theyll happen. And theyll continue to get more sophisticated. As for the actual ethics I think thats one hell of a thorny issue, primarily because theyll continue to get more human as the technology gets better. Is that a good thing? Probably not. I agree that its not going to make the problem of objectification any better. But as for whether it WILL happen? Have you ever met a human being? Once that cats outta the bag itll be impossible to put back in. The whole conundrum will need hella rules to keep it from becoming a nightmare. As to what those rules are, thats up to smarter people than me to figure out."
"Can't speak to the question you asked, but I have one myself: how do you distinguish this from objectophilia?"
One more shower and Im sure Ill get a date
Just build a table bro.
"I legit still keep telling myself that. I've made out and fingered a girl already twice, so I just keep telling myself that it's normal to be a virgin at 18."
it is
Is it? To have only kissed 2 girls by 18? I dont think so. And to be bullied to changing schools 3 times for my looks??? Is that normal too?
lol i didn't even kiss a girl until i was like 21/22 and i still haven't gotten laid yet

Lol... that so true.
Men exist in a hierarchy with other men. To expose a weakness risks being demoted from your position in said structure.

It's not just that no one cares. It's that people hate men who show weakness or emotions. Women hate them most of all.

"Be Like PeteI saw a post on the AskTRP sub yesterday. In it a man described stumbling upon on evidence that his LTR had cheated on him ruthlessly a couple years back. So what did he do? He dropped her instantly. Good move on his part. While I don't advocate snooping around emails and social media to dig up possible dirt I will say he did the right thing by confronting her and kicking her to the curb. However in his post someone dropped a comment titled ""Be like Pete"" and I clicked it. It took me to an archived post from 2016 on the Relationships sub in which a woman had posted that she got dumped for suggesting to her then BF that she was going to visit in an Ex in another country. [Read the post for yourself](https://archive.is/uULD2).. **Lessons learned:** \-Have abundance Mentality: Pete gave no fucks. He knew he could find another chick and didn't care about spending the last 6 months with her. It's easy to drop a girl for bad behavior if you have an abundance mindset aka the confidence in knowing you can easily find more woman. A beta in scarcity mindset would convince himself to keep a bad woman around for fear of being alone. \-Never keep a woman in your life who would even suggest visiting an Ex. It's a huge red flag but she also tried to spin it on him saying he was abusive for not thinking she should do it. \-Men don't want to be friends with good looking women. She honestly thought her ex was just platonic and yet the moment she told him she got dumped he said ""great now we can bang."" (Paraphrasing that) I did a video on this [here](https://youtu.be/Q1osgqLiN6E) if you prefer audio narration of these lessons."

"This is an obvious LARP post, but nonetheless art imitates life and there have been Pete(s) out there before. Good example."
Ahh I didnt even think about that. Youre probably right. Almost too well written.
Even LARPs can be useful. This one is incredibly obvious though.
"If you don't commit to exclusivity you won't be cheating when you bang other women. If your woman doesn't commit to exclusivity she won't be cheating when she bangs other men. That's the real reality of relationships and has been for since forever. (also, it's never cheating when your woman bangs another hot woman, LOL)."
"Original TRP post by u/taracus on this story: http://archive.is/lv4aW >Summary: OP (girlfriend) gets asked by an ""ancient ex"" to meet up in Amsterdam for a week while he is there for work (he lives in Italy and she in the UK). She books the ticket before mentioning anything to her BF because: they were on sale for a ridiculously low price on the dates that he would be there, so I jumped at the opportunity. >Boyfriend breaks up with her without loosing frame and even 'that' subreddit calls her out for being wrong. >Body: So they've dated for 6 months and she thinks that going alone to Amsterdam to meet up with an ""ex from ancient history who is more like a best-friend"" is a good idea. She starts with the excuses even in the title. >Her boyfriend shows exactly how a situation like this are to be handled, no harsh words, no complaining about not going simply holding frame: >Pete seemed cool with it at first but after a few days asked me if there was any history between us. I was honest and told him there was. He didn't seem too bothered and eventually asked if I thought visiting an ex in another country was appropriate whilst in a relationship. I explained to him how Dave and my relationship wasn't like that and that we were strictly platonic. He didn't seem to really react, he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic, I suppose, would be the best way to describe it. >Edit: ""he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic"" -> ""dont need to talk, just grin"" (c) Endorsed TRP-philosophy. >First he calmly suspects that this is more than platonic and asks her and her hamster believes that going a week to Amsterdam with an ex to do drugs and partying is a sign of a ""platonic friendship"" and feels safe confessing that he is actually an ex. He then proceeds to ask if she think its appropriate (not telling her its not, just vetting to see if she is really LTR material). She then pulls out the ""strong independent black woman"" card as a response: >I then told him that I wouldn't be controlled and hated men that thought they owned me and could tell me what to do. I told him I was free to see who I wanted and that I found his lack of trust in me upsetting, disrespectful and, perhaps, a sign of future abusiveness. I now realise that this may have been a bad thing to say. Again, he didn't really react so I thought that was the end of it. >Here most men would have caved, given her reasons not go, told her not to go or even worse, supported the idea of the trip because nobody wants to be an ""abusive boyfriend"". Her boyfriend on the other hand shows exactly how to hold frame he even explains it to her: >Then, last night, he came around to my flat and broke up with me! I asked him why and tried to get him to explain himself and he told me that my going away was to see ""another man"" a deal-breaker, that he'd been in this type of situation before and wasn't going to go through it again. I asked him if this was an ultimatum - I hate ultimatums, they are tools of abusers - and he said ""No, its not an ultimatum. I've decided to break up with you. I have not presented you with any options. I just came to say goodbye."" Before I could say or do anything more, he kissed me on the forehead, said goodbye and walked away. He didn't seem angry, just...sad. >No harsh words, no ultimatums, no anger, just HELD FRAME. He realise a women that cant show her relationship the respect it deserves dont deserve him and he simply lets her go. Here comes some bonus: >To make matters worse, I told Dave about what happened and he replied ""Oh well, guess that means we can have even more fun then! ;o)"" He didn't care about my relationship and my pain - he just wanted a hookup buddy and someone to get stoned with whilst he was in Amsterdam. Suprise, her ex-boyfriend didnt invite her to Amsterdam to party to have a platonic friendship re-kindle. >Obviously both men in this story knew exactly what was up but she comes to the Internet asking for advice of what went wrong. >I tried calling Pete today, about an hour ago, and he actually answered! He told me that I should look to be with someone who wasn't so abusive. He said, ""Please stop calling me - this is over. Have a nice trip to Amsterdam"" Then he BLOCKED me! How could he do that to someone he loves? Is he over reacting or was I? What should I do now? Was I wrong? >""How could he do that to someone he loves?"" she asks herself without any self-reflection (until even the Internet told her that yes, you were wrong). >Lessons learnt: >Women believe in their hamsters, they are not lying when they say they ""didnt cheat"" or ""it just happened"", just because she believes her own lies dont mean you have to. Hold frame, even if your girlfriend is planning on going on a fuck-trip to Amsterdam with an EX. AWALT?"
She's living on your dime and accomplishments. You absolutely have the right to check her stuff as a husband.
"Daves intentions is what I like. Rapey little beta When my GF was shaking off all the orbiters I was always saying shit like you know he wants to fuck you right. He probably jerked off to a girl that looked like you on a porn and thought I should text herpoor little fella is on a dry streak . I would made fishing rod noises and say hes throwing a line see if he can get lucky. But she would lose her shit saying they are not like that bla bla bla just because you fuck any girl you want not everyone thinks like that. I said not want babe because I can, they want but they cant"
>In it a man described stumbling upon on evidence that his LTR had cheated on him ruthlessly a couple years back. So what did he do? He dropped her instantly. Good move on his part. Umm so basic common sense. Big revaluation here.
Title IX Guidance For Schools Modified- Due Process and Cross Examinations Mandated.
"Unless I'm missing something, this sounds like common sense?"
"Well, welcome to the years since the dear colleague letter where Men were getting punished for just being accused, could not bring a lawyer, could not ask any questions, were restricted from submitting evidence such as text messages that might indicate consent. This was all guidance under Obama Under Trump and department of education head Betsy Davos, who is routinely attacked by feminists, it took 2 years to get these reforms out of committee and implemented. Please realize that we have a vocal group on our colleges that want to increase the number of people who are punished for sexual assault.....irregardless or actual guilt or not. Hopefully you understand given this context some of these debates about due process and sexual assault on campus. Men were being kicked out of college and were having to sue under Title IX for discrimination by sex/gender rules."
That's a historic day. Thank you for sharing these news.
[deleted]
"It would seem I need to do some research. I'm curious what the social academic climate was like, or event that occurred, that made this plan of action the one that was agreed upon by policy makers. I am also very surprised men didn't drop out immediately en mass across the country in protest. I'm not American, but I believe many value their rights. If it written explicity to say men are always the perpetrators? Like, a few years ago, were men allowed to make a claim on sexual harrassment/abuse/rape, in which a woman would be denied a fair trial, or was that illegal?"
"Unfortunately, in some areas the application of common sense is radical, revolutionary and widely controversial."
"As I said to a different user, I'm going to have to research *why* Title IX came into practice in the first place. What was happening, real or imagined, that made millions give away their right to a fair trial?"
There was a moral panic. I won't say more out of fear of running afoul of this community's rules against generalization.
"It should be common sense, but our education system is universally bad about providing due process, not just in gender related cases. To make things worse, the first line of recourse is at a hearing which is adjudicated by an ""Administrative Law Judge"" that works for the department of education. Unsurprisingly, most of them don't rule against their employer. Leaving individuals with the burden of appealing to state or federal courts (at additional cost) just to have a chance at receiving due process. While I think the Title IX guidance modification is good, what we really need is our educational institutions to be held to a standard that ensures due process for all cases, and not just those that are gender related."
"A Man's Worst EnemyDiscussed in greater detail on my [daily video.](https://youtu.be/n7msLY3sEjQ) There lurks an enemy in the soul of every man. So insidious is the enemy that many cannot even see it or know it. It is the difference between a rich man and a poor man. A CEO and an underling. A 'has' and a 'has not'. Someone who learns from those who have paved a successful path and someone who complains that they can't be successful and gives excuses. That enemy of man is Instant Gratification. **Examples include:** \-Eating a sugary treat when you know you should eat healthy \-Hitting the snooze button instead of jumping out of bed and working out \-Going out with friends instead of studying finishing that project or studying for that exam \-Taking out a high interest loan and eventually shelling out way more money for it instead of saving for it and paying with cash \-Playing video games instead of building out a business or brand or any other passion that could actually make you money \-Looking at porn and shooting your mojo into a tissue instead of letting it build up and guiding you into starting new relationships In the end, all of these things come down to you being addicted to dopamine. Your body will supply you with dopamine when you do any of the above and there are many more examples than what I just listed. So what is the answer to fighting this? Well that should be obvious. The ally in this fight is Delayed Gratification. But how do we get in contact with this ally? You can throw away your video games and your drugs if you need to. It's an extreme method of control, but if you are constantly succumbing to instant gratification it is something to consider. One of my favorite ways to do that is this: Get in touch with your 'future-self' and ask yourself now what you wish you had done as your 'past-self.' For example... where do you want to be in 20 years? Perhaps a nice house on some big land. 3 cars. Maybe some kids. Maybe not. But do you really want to be living in your parents basement or with roommates? What is your 50 year old self going to say to your 25 year old self? Let me tell you this... as a 34 year old man I curse my 21 year old self. I had ample opportunity to be in the military.. to study hard.. to lift weights earlier.. to be much more successful earlier on. But no, I pissed my early and mid 20s away with video games, marijuana and porn. Yes I still bedded women but for what? My success today is largely based on choices I made in my 30s. My 50 year old self has desires and I cannot let that future man down. Do not let your future-self down! **Lessons Learned:** All the choices we make today shape our future. If you can truly delay gratification you are setting your self up for a much brighter and successful life. If you are constantly giving into your desires for a quick dopamine hit your future will be less than it could have been."

This evening Joe and I will be joined again by my very best friend and Mother of Twins to talk about what happens *during* pregnancy. Or as the title says: there's a baby in there, now what?!?! We'll hit the milestones and decision making with a focus on your relationship and what your man might be going through. But we also want to know what your questions are. You can join us in the live comments during the show, but we'd also love if you drop us a line here through the day. What are your burning questions about pregnancy. This can be anything from symptoms to relationship issues to book recommendations. It's a big topic and we want to be able to cover what is important to the women in the red pill community."

"Why do people tend to bring up issues which ""affect"" them only when they are confronted?(M/20)So, recently a subreddit called r/nepalibabes had been exposed. In thet sub , thousands of men took part in disgusting actions such as doxxing and sharing pictures of girls from Instagram on that sub without their consent, and on top of that discussing about how they would f**k them and making deteriorating comments about their bodies and such. After a few days of them being exposed and confronted , someone posted about a group of girls doing the same, Now , I am not saying that girls doing it is justified or anything but why not speak about this before? Why only speak about this when you've been confronted? Why are people taking this like a competition? Also, the post about the girl's group and the comments on that post were things like ""now feminists will"" ""where are the feminists now"" . Like it feels like the sole purpose of the post was to just get back at the girls who exposed the men on the subreddit in the first place. What are your opinions on this?"

"I kinda think it's the same as when MRA only come and talk about issues men go through to bash a feminist or to retaliate an argument by saying ""men get raped too"" or ""men are assaulted too."" Like we're not denying the fact that they do but why are you coming forth and saying it only when it's convenient for you to retaliate the argument someone just made about problems women face. (*Not to mention that the post still seems very sus to me*)"
"This mentality forever baffles me. Also, its makes highlighting those issues seem very reactionary. Those men issues are also very important, but if those men you describe reallly care about the problem, they will address it & try to solve it independently. Yet in my experience, men who bring up male rape victims as a dismissal of female rape victims are the ones who laugh at prison rape jokes & shame male victims as being weak. Feminists dont expect men to lead the revolution for womens rights, so why do men (like the one described above) want feminists to lead the fight for mens rights? We can be allies for each others cause. This doesnt mean feminists dont advocate for men because we do; I make it a point to also address the inequality that men face. But I prioritize women issues & mainly address womens issues because I am a woman and it directly affects me. Also, to answer OP, people want to justify their behavior by pointing out a nonexistent double standard. They want to believe that girls wouldnt be reprimanded for the same behavior & thus, they are being unfairly targeted. But either way regardless of gender, its wrong."
EXACTLY!!!!
"You know in kindergarten, when Kevin gets caught stealing snacks and yells: ""but Jenny broke a pencil earlier!"" It's basically that. These people don't actually care about what the girls did, if it's comparable, how the victims feel. They care about how they look in comparison. They want to distract from their own flaws by finding someone else to put blame on as well, either by making the other perpetrators look worse, by making it seem like normal behaviour, or be accusing their accusers of ignoring the same issue when it's perpetrated by other groups."
Defensiveness. When you're accused of something awful you deflect the attention to someone else doing it and if you manage to make your accuser look hypocritical you get bonus points. It's very transparent but it works very well.
"And , it is very toxic"
Absolutely. And childish. I can't get over the fact that it works.

"Is anyone else completed socially isolated?Covid aside I've always been without much social interaction and none at all if you discount family. I've always been a believer that being an ugly woman affects more than just your ability to form a romantic relationship with friendships coming in a close second. Human beings as a whole just don't value you or respect your existence when you're ugly. Any 'friends' that I've had would exploit my insecurities by either making fun of things I'm self conscious about, give back handed comments, or state ways in which they look better than me ect. They also just didn't value me as much as their other friends. I'd have to message first, always, or risk not hearing from them, ever. They were always curt and impatient towards me, as if I was a nuisance that should be thankful that they waste their time on me. Because of this I realised a very long time ago that platonic relationships aren't worth my while. I'd love to have a friend but I've yet to find anyone that cares about me even slightly, even the people that seem to be nice to 'everyone'. As such I'm incredibly lonely which is further exemplified by the fact that I've had a lot of bad things happen to me over these past few days, and not even one person to talk to about it. It's soul crushing."
"Me Unless i text first nobody reaches out to me lmaooo. Pretty sure nobody knows i exist in class. My daily routine is go to class, daydream, take the bus home, scroll reddit and eat, wallow in tears until unearthly wee hours of the night. Repeat. But more than looks my social awkwardness also plays a big part i guess... for as long as i can rmb ive always been afraid of people"
"i don't have any offline friends, although, to be fair, i had a severe untreated anxiety disorder before i could even properly form memories which very much affected my ability to form bonds with others. i know a couple girls who are less attractive than me but have lots and lots of popularity (they're top athletes tho)"
I am
I get my social interaction from internet
"I'm exactly the same and it depresses me more and more the older I get. Now that this quarantine is in full motion I can see just how foreign it is for a lot of people to be socially isolated. Whereas for me it's pretty much been my reality for the past couple of years now. I wish I could have a good friend that geniunely wants to spend time with me, but it's unlikely now. Anytime in the past that I've managed to befriend someone, they dump me for a newer, shinier model. And I'm just left to wallow in my own misery. It's painful, and I go through the motions of thinking what did I do wrong, why me etc. But that doesn't help and to be honest, they were never very good friends anyway. Like you mentioned I'd also invest more in the friendship than they did. I still feel a pang of sadness at times, and there's only so much isolation one can take before you descend into madness, but I can't deal with the bullshit anymore. I desire friendship, but I want to feel wanted in my future friendships. If they ever come to fruition. It's a very tumultuous and painful place my mind is in."
Me too honey. Its horrible. I just dont understand. I always had friends growing up. Into my teens and early 20s I had big social circles. I was the funny fat friend. As soon as I lost weight and met a good man. As soon as I was happy they dropped me like a bag of shit. Im talking about women Id been friends with for nearly 20 years. I have my children and my husband but I have no friends. I spent so long wondering why they did that to me. Im so hurt after all wed been through together. Its been a few years now and I really miss having female friends. Even if it were only one. I wouldnt even know how to make friends now. Im most hurt that I was only kept around for an ego boost.
"Same here, when you are ugly people are less likely to approach you first, so you miss out on a lot of social interactions unless you have the guts to talk to people first, which I don't lol"
"I see no-one but family IRL, but play video games with online friends who've never seen my face (and never will!) It's nice, but once you see how much friendlier people are to you when they assume you're decent-looking you can never go back... Still worth it, IMO. Unfortunately, as you've probably realised, it's pretty much impossible to find genuine friends when you're trying. (Decent-looking people don't need to try, so never realise this LOL.) Best thing to do is try and improve your alone time, and dose yourself with bits of social contact (family, internet, etc.) for basic survival. If you're seriously desperate for some one-off social contact, talking about random shit in the Omegle spy question mode kept me above water for a long time. You just have to go through a lot of bots. (I do recommend video games though, it's a really good way to get ""back"" into socialising, since you only really need to talk about the game.) Genuinely sorry you've been having a bad couple of days. I know how it feels to have no-one to talk to. Have you tried journalling? Something that gives me solace is knowing that, after I die, surely some creep will buy my journals on eBay and read all of them LOL, so I write to that person."
Yes. Me. The only phone number in my agenda is my mom.
"Elizabeth Holmes documentary film is outhttps://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley If you havent read Bad Blood its well worth the time to watch this film. Why this is important to masculists: The first celebrated self made female billionaire ended up being a fraud. The second (MacKenzie Bezos) achieved her wealth through divorce and donates to womens causes. One can draw their own conclusions quite easily on human nature, what the Western world face economically and culturally, and the future of brutality towards men and boys given the circumstances."
Rumors by the end were that she was faking her voice. But by now I doubt she even knows what she sounds like herself.
"She sounds like a girl who should be in jail, yet she isn't, hmmm."
Yea why is that? For awhile it seemed like she was everywhere. You couldnt not see her face somewhere everyday and it was always with headlines that seemed like they were closing in on her and her bullshit. Now its nothing. Crickets. Did she get away with her shit? Even if she did wouldnt there be a ton of lawsuits from investors wanting their money back?
"From the looks of [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/theranos-founder-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-life-story-bio-2018-4%3Famp) she's awaiting trial for federal fraud to start in August, but with the pandemic I'm sure it'll be moved around. I'm guessing she's not in the news anymore because there's ""bigger"" problems"
It's very rare rich people go to jail.
What do you think about complaints of historical accuracy in medieval settings regarding inclusion of women and minorities?
"They are almost always a sign about latent racism or sexism. Number one because most of the times the complaints they have are not even accurate. I think there might be a small percentage that really cares about the accuracy, but there are also a lot of people that usually don't care about that kind of things but get this kind of strong reaction when race or gender changes are involved. You can usually tell how genuine they are being by how they choose to make their argument."
"Literally just sexism/racism disguised as historical accuracy About 99% of the time: 1)The characters they are say are historically inaccurate are actually perfectly accurate. 2) there's something even more glaringly obviously inaccurate, like there being magic wizards in a historical setting or what not"
Suspension of disbelief is necessary for the enjoyment of any media. Don't think about the hamburger too hard before you eat it.
Im amazed at how people like male gamers who always complain when there are female and POC characters in medieval settings never seem to have a problem with series like Elder scrolls where there are MANY female and POC characters without any fan service. I think the complaints only start rolling in when the struggles of being a minority or a woman are an important part of the story or when the fact that the character is a minority is emphasized in some way that bothers them. I really dont understand it. Maybe the Elder scrolls series is just so good that they dont mind. Any piece of media that contains a woman or minority needs to be twice as good as the average one without them in order for it not to be called propaganda.
"Maybe we need more stories of ""majority"" characters overcoming their privilege and finding out how to be a good ally. I don't actively seek social justice themed media but i feel like having good social justice themed role models would help the upcoming generations. I know for a lot of white men social justice is a confusing mess of rules and regulations for them and it kinda just turns them off of any kind of allyship. The elder scrolls may borrow historically accurate settings (each race being a historical race/empire) but they do such a good job of blending those historical connections into an original lore that you lose any grounds for historical accuracy. As for women in the game, the series touches on slavery, criminal rights, racism, war crimes, nationalism, classism etc. but it rarely talks about women's liberation. Women in the game just kind of exist as characters they're not the lesser and they're not some cheesy ""me women, hear me roar"" trope."
"While there were power imbalances, remember that: -50 percent of the population has always been women -Most European countries were more racially diverse than we've come to imagine"
it's just racists and sexists' way of justifying their hatred towards women and minorities
"Matthew Colville talks about this and a few other issues in his video called the sociology of D&D. He talks about creating and running a fantasy game for friends but in it I think he touches on something that is applicable to all forms of media unless youre literally going to run a game set on earth during a historical period, theres no reason for your world to have anything from our world in it unless you think its neat or useful."
Since these are usually fantasy settings it says a lot about what they fantasize about

"Naw bro, ugly men don't date ugly women. They just don't date anyone. And by regular metrics, 4/5 of men are ugly lol."
"Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, such as sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals. The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people."

"Your identity catches up to your actions and vice versa.We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore our habits shape and create our lives and our identity. Our identity does the same in reverse. When you decide upon improving yourself, whether you start by eating healthier, working out, cold showers... you should aim for attaining an identity of someone who eats healthy, who works out, who takes cold showers, not necessarily the act itself. This is so because, our ego is our biggest factor of motivation for keeping or developing habits. If you perceive yourself in a certain way, you will subconsciously strive to do what makes you remain that way, which is why breaking bad habits is so hard. You are comprised of them (good or bad) Most important thing to keep in mind is to have patience and not get discouraged by not seeing immediate results. If you workout once, twice and so on you have to keep doing it until your identity catches up to your actions. When your identity catches up and you are a person who works out on a regular basis no strings attached, then it becomes automatic and requires little to no willpower. Also don't get dissapointed if you for example have developed a healthy habit of working out, but can't seem to do work/study consistently or whatever else. Each habit requires it's own growing and nurturing, but a carryover effect is real. Make your life a rolling ball of compounding quality healthy habits and don't go in all at once, start small."

I think the ""setting your mind ahead of the task"" is likely more mindful..."
Man that last paragraph hit the nail on the head for me. I workout consistently but have been struggling with focusing on everything else. Good stuff.

If you are the nail that rises out of the wood plank you will be shamed until you get in line.. Japan was in advance for it's time in the 80-90 in 2020 not really. Oh and don't get in trouble with the police here, they only prosecute if they are 100% sure you're gonna be convicted because of ""the system"". Google it for more info it's crazy."
"This has been really eye opening. When I was a kid, Japan seemed like the land of the future. But it seems to be one giant mental health tinder box instead. Hope you are still able to enjoy your time there."
They can't(and don't want to) deal with mental issues and the pressure is so hard that some Japanese just give up and become hermits (Hikikomori). They also work themselves to death they even have a term for it Karshi They do have heated toilet seat but the land of the rising sun has bigger social issues.

"Do you have fantasies of sacrificing yourself?So that your suffering ends, and others can see that despite their assumptions, you're not ugly on the inside too? Accepting that you may not be liked or even accepted, but at least you could be... useful? I've had this one where I could save my crush in a quest, but some evil mastermind made it so that I'd have to die. He tried tricking us first but I figured it out and agreed still. Then I was sacrificed in front of my crush and some crowd, so they could be let go and live. I would think everyone hates me anyways so this is perfect, and in the end I get to see who I love last, which makes it an all around happy ending. Sometimes I'd tell my crush to promise me to be happy, sometimes they would already have a gf, or I'd become a ghost and observe them being happy. This was more realistic than being liked back and dating. I felt guilty and gross if I imagined us together, but the bittersweet an hero story gave me a good night's sleep. Can anyone relate? I asked this question on a general questions site once and got ridiculed for it."
>not ugly on the inside too nope i fail at that also and i'm not pure enough to be sacrificed
yep. my personality is just as repulsive as my exterior. :))
When I was a teen I used to tell myself that it's true I'm ugly but I have a good heart and morals and that's enough..but now I'm not so sure about that as it looks like different people's opinion of me never changes...

I get what you mean. My thoughts are more 'guy' orientated because my older brother and his friends were the only kids willing to play with me when I was little.
Yes
Yes fucking all the time... not to schizo post but sometimes I write up like a manifesto explaining all the issues that come with being a horribly ugly social outcast and then I fantasize about killing myself and having everyone read it and finally understand. But I know that if I actually did that that no one would care after like a couple of months.

"While i think she should be punished hard for this, I dont think we should compare drugging and robbing to drugging and raping."
"Also male rappers talk about committing crimes all the time and nobody is calling for them to be in jail. You can self admit to whatever, if everything someone said was assumed to be true wed have no singers making songs or actors giving lines or anything..."

that's true. but high n count does in fact contribute to high divorce rates and unstable relationships
"Absolutely. The fact there number is high shows they cant commit long term. Then because they have had so many its harder to stay in one after the fact. Some women in my family are like this, many boyfriends none very long. I can tell why they cant keep an LTR(dont know about their sex life). The fact they have had so many fail(for what ever reason) means theyve never learned how to act in an LTR, nor matured at all. Still really quick to cause problems and run the minute things require compromise or change to their life, like guy friends, flirtation, etc. they cant stop that stuff, they survive off of it. And this is always why the guy leaves."
i agree here too. although in this girl's case she said that it was always the guys leaving her. i don't think she really had a father figure growing up. although i don't know for sure
">where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily another alpha widow in the making. a shocker, as you said. gotta love how women make their speech complicated and coded e.g ""special connection"". thanks for reminding how important the tingles are, OP"
Pair bonding ability = destroyed. Too many hot Chad's pumped and dumped her into oblivion. Pure alpha widow.
"""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" Something tells me that you arent the only guy she said this to. She is desperate to have 'love' in her life and she'd do anything to keep her catch."
"You're not a beta becoming an alpha. You're an alpha recovering from a fucking disease!Today I had a fucking epiphany. I've always thought of myself, deep down in my subconcious, as a beta. No matter what I was trying to do, I was a beta, because I was thinking so of myself. I made some money... still a beta, cause why not? I somehow fucked some girls... still a beta, cause why not? Worked out, dieted, turned my body into a fucking anciet greek sculpture... still a beta in my mind, cause why not? No matter what I did, I was a beta. No matter how better I got and how much I advanced, I was still a beta and I was to remain a beta, whatever great achievement I might've had. **Because I was brainwashed into it!** This my simple epiphany. We are brainwashed by the society to think very lowly of ourselves, the government wants us as manipulable as possible, so they instill these thoughts in us ever since we're kids. We, as men, we naturally are alphas, thanks to our biology, thanks to our dick, balls and endocrine system and thanks to our anatomy, we're BUILT BY NATURE to conquer, or at least to relentlessly try to conquer as best as possible. There's not one single motherfucker out there, who's a natural born beta, there isn't such a thing. Think of it this way: you start out as an alpha by nature the moment you're born, and your anatomy is there to confirm it. Then, with each passing day, society, friends, family, the government, the massmedia, social media, start fucking with you, a little here, a little there while you're growing up, instilling certain retarded, against your nature thoughts in your brain, which don't benefit you, but benefits them, until you forget your true, masculine, animalistic, conquering nature, thus, you become a little puppet. This is why you always feel an interior conflict, this is why usually you feel anxiety and depression. You KNOW who you are, deep down. You very well know what the fuck you feel like doing and saying, there's a little voice and instinct in your head that you feel like you should follow because it's gonna turn out good. But just before starting to follow that instinct, you start thinking... ""but what if he thinks I'm a weirdo cause I didn't laught at his joke? Better start fake laughing"", ""but what if she thinks that I'm not a good boy that she can trust, better not tell her how retarded she sounds"", that's the voice of your fake beta that has been instilled in you, taking over your natural alpha instincts. Retarded ideologies which go against rationality and biology: feminism, gay acceptance, veganism, fat acceptance. Cheap pleasures such as: 24/7 pornography, junk food, sugar, on demand pointless entertainment (netflix, youtube, tik tok). Stupid bandaids: anti-depressive pills, pushing any sort of medicine down your throat, getting you addicted to xanax and all that shit. Mind games: the purposeful lack of certain education, the purposeful miseducation in some areas, slave 9-5 working making you believe you're a champion, meanwhile you're making some other dude rich. They want you to be a mindless zombie. ""Don't brag, be humble"" ""Stop judging people"" ""Accept them for who they are"". They want you to have no personality. To be like a falling leaf, floating in whatever direction the wind blows. They feed you cheap pleasures. Junk food. Stupid entertainment. Crap medicine. Filling your brain with cheap dopamine. Keeping you docile, like a tranquiliezed lion in a cage. You think you're a good man, because you believe in God, you go to work, you get your monthly salary, you fuck your wife and raise your kids, which you do... but you're doing it on their terms. You're not free, you're theirs, until you break out of this mental pattern. Fuck them. The only way out of the cage is by forming your OWN opinions. You don't like fat people? Good, me neither, fuck them, fat shame them until they lose weight. You don't like hobos? Good, me neither, fuck them, they should go to work and not beg like some losers. STAND FOR SOMETHING. If you don't stand for something, any fucking thing at all, there's gonna be an empty spot inside you waiting to be filled. It's gonna be filled by something else and someone else, unless YOU FILL IT FOR YOURSELF. You're not a beta trying to become alpha. You're an alpha recovering from a fucking disease!"

Exactly! And the initiated don't need the obvious.
Let's delete this subreddit and stop posting at all then lmao
Writing style could be improved but bit rich of you to say considering how much of your post history is just you spamming prices of torrented programmes (which you got for free). Wouldnt you agree?
"If they were to torrented why would anyone buy from me. Ergo, they were NOT torrented."
this is a really great post.

"A question related to womans reproductive health and research.Honest question about issue facing woman reproductive health. The other day a friend of mine got some eggs frozen because she was going to have to go through Chemo and most likely become infertile. The process to due so is for lack of a better word intense and actually not without risk. And the chance of them being viable isnt even super high. This got me thinking. Freezing storing sperm is easy well researched and often has a high success rate. It not the case for females and maybe the reason is actually the process. It can take up too two weeks, you can be unable to do normal activity for up to a week after wards and that is all with no complications. My question was knowing that the amount of research put into freezing eggs is rather low compared to the research into freezing sperm [i mean compare the process and just how hard getting samples would be. With eggs being so much harder to obtain less people donate to science plus you get much less at once per person] should instead of focusing on using the current method, should more research money be spent on a safer way to induce ovulation and for removal instead of focusing so much on raising the egg survival rate? Edit: sorry if this is a confusing mess I am not the best at writing out what I am thinking. The question is in short: due to the risky nature of the current process to indue ovulation for freezing eggs, would it make more sense to spend the research money on a safer way to induce ovulation instead of just on how to raise the success/survival rate of frozen eggs since a safer [and hopefully much cheaper] process would make it more accessible to more woman. And more accessibility would equal more control over when and were you want kids and the ability too still have them later in life. I also could be completely wrong not being a doctor or any kind of expert on female biology [ex I am not female]"
"So because of the differences in how the gametes function-- ovaries vs. testes, no amount of funding will ""close the gap"" re: the number of eggs it's possible to stimulate for harvest compared to the average number of sperm produce in any given ejaculation. While I do agree more money should be invested on reducing how invasive the process is (and how difficult the procedure is to undergo and recover from) for people with ovaries, because they are internal organs and testes are external, there's only so much that can be done in that respect as well. I think because of those hard limitations on the potential advancements for oocyte collection, research has focused on making the eggs collected more viable for longer-- specifically because they are harder to get in the first place. I don't see this as an injustice-- it's just the result\* given the reality of biological differences."
"I dont see it as an injustice either it was more so, me not being a woman I was wondering from a female view which part of the process needs the most work. Since sometimes in the March of scientific progress we dont always stop and ask the people what they need as opposed just marching forward. So thank you for your insight."
"How would you propose conducting this research? Forcing a womans body to rapidly cycle through ovulation and menstruation? I dont believe thats even possible. More than likely, the ovaries would just shutdown ovulation or cause an insane amount of pain as the repro system struggles to get back on its own rhythm."
"I cant think of a single acceptable way to conduct the research mainly because requiring anyone get a truly unnecessary invasive medical procedure is in its unethical, uncivilized, and flat out dangerous. The question mainly was about since the resources are limited [money] or extremely limited [eggs] that I feel how they are allocated is a question for those most effected and wanted to hear what they had to say. Would it be better spent on raising the success rate of freezing the eggs? Would it be better spent on the nature of the procedure to induce ovulation and making that less dangerous and invasive?"
"Freezing eggs for sure. Theres no way to make egg harvesting less invasive, unfortunately. Id actually reckon the best way to improve the entire process is figuring out how to de-age the reproductive system so eggs harvested are the best possible quality, and preserve ones ability to conceive."
People with ovaries
TERF you later.
"my mother doesnt have ovaries. She had to have them removed due to her period causing them to swell up and press back into her spine causing debilitating pain. I honestly take offense to this, the idea that what because someone doesnt have ovaries they are less of a woman? Accidents cancer all kinds of things can lead to issue with ovaries. Are those people less of a woman?"
"The successful post-thaw survival rate for eggs is quite high (85% for over 36s and 95% got unfrt 36s). The lower success rates that exist in general are for IVF. The complications that arise with successfully regaining fertility off of frozen eggs are not to do with the freezing procedure itself. Also there are very small differences in IVF success rates when one uses fresh vs frozen eggs , so that adds further evidence to support the idea that the problem is not a suboptimal freezing process."
"nothing bothers them more than ugly people not ""acting according to their looks"""
The answer is yes. Yes they do. Especially if you're a woman.

"Tiktok is awful for this. You literally can't post a video if you're not attractive without getting completely torn apart, threatened, and mocked in the comments. Unattractive people are expected to hide out of courtesy."
"I hate those tiktok cringe compilations for this reason. The videos are just cringe because the people are considered unattractive. If it was Loren Gray doing it, it would be funny and quirky."
tiktok cringe is just ugly people doing all the same trends everyone else does lol its fucked...like what they're not allowed to use the fucking app because they're not 5'10 blonde and skinny?
I had a friend saying about other girl..xyz....like this...She thinks she is so beautiful...wow .

"Ahh yes. How dare you think that your own mother, sister, wife and daughter deserves the same rights as you? /s"
Exactly
I think that the only reason why they want to take away women's rights is because then they could rape without any legal conscience
"Yeah, but then their female family members could also be raped without any punishment as well, then again, I'm unsure if many care"
They won't.
That's sad

"I felt brainwashed twiceAfter a devastating breakup resulting in my ex spinning plates, abusing and moving on. I saw myself swallowing the red pill , black pill whole which changed my perspective completely. Saw myself hating women, even the ones who are good to me... I became overly critical , analytical now I can't stop but I want to. I'm sick of this shit. Ignorance was bliss, becoming red pilled depressed the fuck out of me. Anyone who's felt this , would appreciate your help"
"The trick is to stop looking for ways in which women are different from you, and start looking for the ways in which you are the same. Men and women, in the grand scheme, are far more alike than we are different, and the more time you spend talking to women on a human to human level rather than a man to woman, the more you will see that. Generally speaking, female motivation and male motivation come from the same human desires. The desire for companionship, the desire for validation, the desire for safety. The differences in how we seek these things is largely socialized and even so varies wildly among those in the same societies. AWALT is nothing more than a joke in bad taste made by the bitter and jaded and should not be taken seriously."
"Thanks for your reply, ive tried it before i do find that difficult as I just find myself hardwired to find an intent. They'd literally give a fuck more the day you change your profile picture and look more attractive in it or you raise your status or get that bigger paycheck. They know you'll chase them and youre being nice ,slowly cringes them."
"Your eyes ever light up the moment you notice a pretty girl you havent met before? Or one you have thats just done herself up nicer? Its the same damn thing. Humans are hardwired to notice them. Men and women are no different in this. Similarly, men and women sometimes like to trade up so to speak. The self made millionaire who divorces his middle aged wife and marries a 22 year old art student? Its a trope for a reason. Men and women both are equally capable of being shitty human beings. What holds relationships together in the face of adversity and temptation are character traits like compassion, loyalty, communication, ethics, etc... In other words, the same character traits that make any person a good partner in the first place, male or female. Red pill will cherry pick statistics and deliberately obscure or ignore conflicting data in order to paint women as the villains, but its all a sham. Humans are shitty to each other, and its each of our individual responsibility to ensure were not continuing to be part of the problem."
It sucks that Lms videos make so much sense.
They only make sense in a vacuum. You can prove almost anything if you spend enough time making YouTube videos that cherry pick and misinterpret data and dont allow for easy rebuttal. Pick any crazy conspiracy and there will be a whole YouTube rabbit hole that conclusively proves how it must be.
Thanks man I needed some of this.
"What helped me was not focusing so much on women. Focus on your career/school/hobbies/friendships/social life, whatever. Just not on constantly getting laid. I found my life got better (cause I was putting more effort in, no shit), but also, I'd ended up with more female friends that I used to have. (When I was focused on TRP, I had 0 female friends because I'd try to sleep with them all.) And once you have some female friends that you regularly interact with, it's much harder to just hate a whole gender..."

"[SocJus] Timothy Donohoo / CBR - ""The Rising of the Shield Hero Is Absurdly Popular for NO Good Reason"""
"Translation: This thing has absolutely no woke buzz pansexual isms, therefore it is the worst thing since hitler!"
"> Fittingly, the show's ownreputation and critical receptionare lower than dirt, and for good reason. Thestory kicking off with the hero being falsely accused of rape was especially controversial, with many seeing it as being at odds with the zeitgeist of the #MeToo movement, if not wholly opposing it. This led to many Western fans in particular criticizing the series for its casual misogyny, though the sentiment was significantly less felt in Japan. Regardless, though this plot point is played for laughs, many felt that the confines of a fantasy isekai might not be the best place to handle such a serious topic. Silly blogger didn't get the message that metoo is cancelled because their man Biden got the finger pointed at him..."
"The plot point was never played for laughs I assume as always they didn't watch the show . It turns completely generic later on , would've been way more interesting if it stuck to the more interesting ideas in the first few eps. But the fake rape allegation is never a jokey point ."

I don't do anime/manga and dunk on it every chance I get and even *I* thought this you-aren't-permitted-to-like-it article was over the top. Journalism 2020!
">With an overpowered protagonist who's seemingly never wrong, topped with **socially contentious undertones**, the series has gotten its fair share of well deserved flak. Despite this, it continues to find a fanbase, as evidenced by its consistently high ranking on sites like Crunchyroll. **Here's a look at how one of today's worst anime has become one of its most popular.** So the arguments seems to literally be ""I disagree with some of the supposed messages of this anime, so obviously it being popular makes no sense"". >The controversial elements might actually be a boon for the show's popularity. Some viewers may seek out Shield Hero because of its taboo, almost risque reputation, while others might even sympathize with the protagonist. **This would justify the show's label as an ""incel fantasy,""** but it would also explain why **rampant criticism has failed to break the show's viewership.** Weird how someone who might empathize with a character being wrongly maligned and mistreated by powerful social elements might not react positively to criticism revolving around how it's apparently *morally wrong* to ever portray a woman abusing societal expectations for personal gain. There's a few limp-wrist complaints about generic anime tropes thrown in, but its pretty easy to tell the driving reason this dude hates Rising of the Shield Hero is because it was declared guilty of wrongthink for having an evil female character do something an evil female character would do, but those damn incel anime fans kept enjoying it anyway."
"It's absurdly popular because the bar for isekai is so low that Rising of the Shield Hero being just okay makes it exception and Raphtalia is the cutest reverse-loli to exist. Isekai is so steeped in the same cliches, over and over, that it felt *ground breaking* to have the protagonist NOT be beloved by every single character he meets and have to endure a *bad reputation*. I'm not condemning it for not being deep, it's a satisfying popcorn story with some good hooks. I only read the manga and couldn't get far into the anime but when I read it, yeah that shit was engaging. That protagonist gets falsely accused of rape is so controversial because *people can't stand the thought of men being victims or women being villains* is what really blows my mind. Total Duluth Model of kool-aid drinking. > The source material was one of the first web light novels to be translated into English, opening a new world of potential readers, and eventually viewers, to an underdog, no-name web novel author. I could be wrong but I thought this was standard in Japan? There's no gatekeeping with editors or literary agents so the internet is basically flooded with original fanfics with people voting on what they like. This makes it very easy for authors to copy one another, which is why ever since Sword Art Online blew up isekai has not only become popular but each isekai story is super derivative and formulaic when you compare them to each other. Sure there are a few exceptions but for the most part you can tell exactly what the author had already read/watched when they made their own isekai. The market has become so flooded online that people have started getting *really* creative with their story titles because something as Moonlight Breakfast doesn't quite grab the reader's attention as much as Who In Their Right Mind Would Make Toast With Their Butt. So what happens is officials take a look at what LNs online are popular, the LN gets a real book deal and published in meat space while an anime is adapted asap to cash in on its popularity. The market has also become so flooded that over the past few years they've started to pull away from ""teenage male protagonist"" stories so authors started developing new gimmicks such as reincarnation."

"When is it okay for men to wear feminist things?Hi there. I'm a 20-something year old male and recently I kinda got in touch with my angsty side. Listening to punk rock and the sorts. I also care a lot about social equality movements. So I recently got a jean jacket and decorated it with different patches. Two of those patches were a Rosie the Riveter and Feminism patch. One of my friends said it was kinda cringe that I had them on there because I wasn't a girl and it comes off as ""white knighty"". Which makes me feel weird about having them on there. I thought it was important to show solidarity with the feminist movement because I grew up with a sister and its been amazing to see how its affected her and the woman she's become because of it. I truly believe in the cause and have been involved with the cause for a long time now. So I just need to hear some opinions on what you think about guys that wear feminist things."
"I think the cringe here is your friend, to be honest. I think your patches are awesome."
Honestly anyone who calls stuff you do cringe isnt worth listening to.
"i think that it's super cool that your doing what you want and being expressive, and the support for all social justice movements will be appreciated!!"
It's nice to know where your allies are at. Men wearing feminism gear always makes me think of how much I love [Patrick Stewart](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/prdht/this_is_what_a_feminist_looks_like_patrick/)
Sounds like your friend has some insecurity going on. Tell him to calm down its just a fucking patch. Good for you for being brave enough to openly show your solidarity with women. Sad that its apparently cringeworthy to some.
"Men can wear feminist things whenever they want. Ideally, they are also good allies and feminists, as well as wearing the gear."
"The point of displaying the feminism is because it is cringy to some people. Thats how you show you believe in social change, even if it makes people uncomfortable. Thats why, if I move to Idaho for a potential job offer, Ill display a gay pride flag."
Never be ashamed. Ever. Your honesty and sincerity mean a lot to you and to express those feelings will potentially mean a lot to those around you. I'm in the same boat (28 yo male) and it can be a little scary but it's worth it. You know it's sincere and that's all that matters.
"Your friend is cringe, and also doesn't understand what white knighting is. Your patches sound cool."
Casually assaulting silly boys because offended by stuff.
aight he didn't hit back either cuz he doesn't like to hit woman or he knew there are white knights waiting for him to touch her so they can beat him up lol
Best bet is to just call the cops. It was recorded and everything.

"17 Year Old Indian Boy committed suicide after being accused of sexual harrasment by a girl on an Instagram post, 2 years after the alleged assault has taken place without any evidence."
"A class 12 student allegedly committed suicide in Gurugram's residential condominium by jumping from the balcony of his flat. IANs has reported that he jumped from the 11th floor of the building. As per a report in the Hindustan Times, he was accused by a girl of molestation on social media, the police said. He was named in a MeToo post on social networking site Instagram. The post from the girl came on the day when the Bois Locker Room group controversy came to light, which has triggered nationwide outrage. HT mentions an officer saying: No suicide note was found but messages retrieved from the boys phone showed that fellow students warned him that he will be questioned by the police. Reports say that the police are investigating the deceased boy's alleged involvement in Bois Locker Room Instagram account. His phone has been seized and sent for analysis. The cyber crime cell has been looped in. His social media account and chats will be investigated to help understand why he took the extreme step. The report says, ""The police official ruled out any foul play during preliminary investigation. The deceased has not left any suicide note. Further action will be taken only after detailed reports of his mobile analysis is received. As of now, legal proceedings under CrPC 174 have been initiated."" As NCR fights against the Covid-19 situation, the incident involving a group of social media users on Instagram came to light. The incident, now known as Bois Locker Room incident, made news after a girl from South Delhi shared a screenshot on social media. The screenshot went viral. The screenshot brought to light the activities on this particular group, where the users, as it appeared on the screenshot, showed school boys sharing photos of underage girls. The chats have shown the boys to have objectified the girls and to have planned 'gang rapes'. Almost all the 21 members of the group have been identified. They will be examined. Owing to the lockdown, the 15-year-old apprehended has not yet been produced before the juvenile justice (JJ) board, this report says. The boy is said to have told counsellors and police that he was added by a classmate to the group during the last week of March. After some days, they added a total of 51 people to their group and also made another group. Some of them allegedly started sharing photos posted by girls on their Instagram accounts. Some allegedly shared morphed photos as well, the Indian Express report quotes an officer saying. Deccan Herald says in its report that the Cyber Cell had filed an FIR in the case under sections 67, 67(A) of the Information Technology Act, and other IPC Sections. The case was filed on 4"

It is big time govt. especially from poor countries like India should control such narratives and punish those create such dirty narratives.

Being falsely accused of sexual harassment is nothing to kill yourself over. You are more important than worthless pixels on a screen.

I'm not a huge fan of memes but anytime one of them can make me laugh out loud like this one I accept they belong here.
"The sad thing is that in the very near future, scenarios similar to this are going to be the new normal. The number of youths with profound mental health issues is going to skyrocket. Kids stumbling upon their classmates' mothers' old porn videos online will become an everyday thing. Yes, that WILL happen. The resulting teasing and bullying will be otherworldly in scope."
"Yeah, love her in-shock/attentive expression."
I hope she is going to show how she streams programming live.

"Something I've noticed as a way to identify submissive girls is they'll address you as ""sir"" in a situation in which it isn't inappropriate but in which it kind of stands out. It's essentially an invitation for you to take things further."

"Nope and I don't particularly remember what that one was. Just a throwaway ""funny"" I think."
IDK in my experience all girls are submissive just depends on who they are submitting to. Two friends. One girl. Coworkers. Super nice friendly totally does one of the guys says. Other guy has opposite interactions. Stubborn mean entitled. They all will submit just depends if they see you as top or not.
Exactly. *All* women are submissive in nature. This post is just redundant.
Your alluding to the waiter being a womens study major cracked me up. Good post.
"Great post with usable tactics. There should be a ""Tactics"" flair for these posts, versus ""Theory"" posts. I never had trouble, generally speaking, with confidence. But all the little behavioral cues that society ingrained into me as ""right"" and ""correct"" had to be shed before I first really felt the power of TRP. Even little Beta shit like saying ""sorry"" when I bump someone at the store. It all had to be shed, but it also had to be replaced with something. And for me, anyway, it was finding and implementing the right *tactics* in place of all the bullshit that I was filled up with. So it's great to say ""do not give a fuck"" but how does that actually look in context. What I find, much like V. reports, is that women will resort to overt communication if you're just nailing the tactics: >**She flat out told me,** *I like to feel how strong you are.* Overt communication in this context means you're doing it right."
"Are there any practical good/real sex education videos for demo and that's not porn?I don't want porn videos and the videos that I see on YouTube are just theory. Most guys don't realise but it's one of the sticking points. If you're aware of what you're going to do to the girl, you'll show much more confidence when talking to her I've openly discussed with a few girls and they've told how most guys don't know what they are doing and that's also one of the reasons they don't want to see the guy again. She is not your school teacher to teach you what you want to do to her. I get that practising is one of the things but not all guys have the luxury to practise on several different girls for whatever reason. So when you have the girl, you should know what you're doing"
I like the channel Don of Desire on YouTube. Not all are good but there are some videos that can help you get better in what you already know and learn new things too.
"I can recommend ""Big O"" by Lou Paget. In this book u can read more about woman's orgasm and how to do it. I found it very informative and it helps me to do better sex w/ my gf. Hope it can helps u too."

"Well it's not the kind of sex education to procreate I'm talking about. Not like, ""Bam, Bam, thank you Ma'am"". It's more about foreplay, positions, touching, seducing, increasing sexual tension, cunnilingus, stroking, blowjob, roleplay, multiple orgasms etc There are books about it but I want to see the body language, facial expressions, verbal and non-verbal communication etc Ex: I know how a cunnilingus is done but I want to see what are other parts of your body doing. Like, where are your hands, is it holding her boobs or is it holding her butt, how deep are you using your tongue, how long do you stay in a position and how not to get tired etc. You'll learn a lot more when you see than reading"
I'd like to hear what the women you and everyone you know of have been with have to say about it. Might not be what you expect.
Some are really lusty and want to be fucked hard and thats all
Still would like them to weigh in. Somehow I think it would be enlightening.

"Is it just me or is it time to normalise non-invasive vasectomies the way we do IUDs? #ittakestwoBefore anyone gets defensive, lets break this down. Non-invasive vasectomies are...NON-INVASIVE. Theyre an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it, theyre compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from, and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics. The only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder (and completely possible) to reverse, and that insurance doesnt cover reversal (but they do cover vasectomies). Now lets discuss IUDs. In a lot of countries, people who havent given birth aret considered for IUD procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia. Im not mentioning it because I agree, but because of the implications of severity. Most women are given ibuprofen, which doesnt do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening (that is closed tight) with a rod to insert an IUD. For those who are having a hard time imagining, think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra. As for side effects, where do I even begin? Constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion? Weight gain? Acne? Fever and debilitating cramps after insertion? Severe PMS mood swings that border on clinical depression? Life threatening (ectopic) pregnancy? Irregular/heavy bleeding until its taken out? Increase risked of infections? Perforation (piercing through the uterus wall)? Extreme cramping with a copper (non-hormonal) IUD? I am sick and tired, and frankly, disgusted, by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce. And for the people who think: not my body, not my problem, you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking? Birth control comes with awful side effects, and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday? Do you know what its like to make plans always having to consider that? Compared to a one-time non-invasive, outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy? I see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting IUD insertions. Its about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties. Dear women, dont feel discouraged. Im iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved, men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it. I want to reiterate, Im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. Im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them. #ittakestwo [Edit: I dont know if vasectomies are a viable solution. BUT...I would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured. If theres such a huge burden on women, isnt it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely? Are womens burdens THAT insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality? THAT insignificant that we shut down solutions because the IDEA of it causes discomfort? THAT insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain?]"
"You present your point very well. Do you have any additional information about the reversal procedure (success rates, nature of the operation, etc.)?"
"> I want to reiterate, Im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. Im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them. I think that OP did a great job of presenting their argument and I see no effort to pit people against one another. I'm not well enough informed about the science regarding IUD and vasectomy to suggest that one is better than the other, but I'm all for people taking responsibility and making informed decisions about birth control."
"Im not saying one is better then the other. Thats a very holistic thing. But I will say that statistics support vasectomies being the most potent form of birth control how-not-to-get-pregnant My main issue is the double standards. Women already have to go through enough with menstrual cycles and pregnancies. Im not saying women have it better or worse than me, just that reproduction is a particularly difficult aspect. Menstruated cycles and pregnancy already hurt women. Birth control hurts women even more. So hopefully by talking about male birth control, starting a conversation, debunking myths, reporting statistics and facts, we can facilitate a safe environment where men can learn/talk about birth control, see the pain that women bear, and can normalise taking responsibility in a completely safe and healthy way.create a safe environment where taking some responsibility doesnt mean hurting yourself in the process"
"Thank you! TBH, Ive read an innumerable amount of articles on google and formulated opinions accordingly. I read articles that support or negate points of views so I dont succumb to confirmation bias. I know just because an article is on google doesnt make it accurate but its a good starting point. TL;DR Ive read too many articles and dont know enough to suggest any as additional information"
"Agreed! It does take two and I wish there was an alternative to the pill on the market for men. But from studies on hormonal birth control for men, it looks like men aren't all that willing to put a bunch of foreign hormones, that can alter their lives and have a bunch of side effects into their bodies. Women don't really have the luxury to say no to birth control. I have a feeling it will take a long time for young men to accept even non-invasive vasectomies as a viable birth control method, because it is seen as something men get who know they're done having children."
"I think normalizing the conversation should 100% be on the table. Whether or not it's feasible yet comes later. Men shouldn't be afraid of a possible option for something like this. Bonus rant incoming: My biggest frustration comes from the fact that women are often given the responsibility of contraception. Birth control pills, IUDS, tying tubes, the morning after pill. Men who are sexually active should not have to be asked to put a condom on, even when women are using another form of BC. If both parties agree not to use condoms, that needs to be agreed to as the follow-up. I'm sick of feeling bad for men who say condoms don't feel as good, completely ignoring the suffering women go through to be the responsible party. Let's also not ignore the cost. If you don't wear a condom, you should have to *at least* pay for half of the morning after pill. This drives me mad. I pay for period supplies and BC pills, monthly. The least men could do is pay for some condoms and morning after pills."
"This! My boyfriend paid half of my IUD, because he's the reason I got it in the first place."
"Its really hard not to get angry that this is the first time Ive ever even heard of this procedure. It needs to be a main stream option. Why is it not? Ladies, I dont want to scare anyone out of an IUD by saying this, because it was 1,000% worth it, but holy shit it was the most painful thing Ive experienced in my adult life. I have absolutely no sympathy for anyone who might argue this procedure is too invasive for men. Edit: Wait, Im Confused. Is this procedure reversible without surgery? It doesnt sound compatible to an iud"
I agree completely. At the very least there should be more pressure and demand for male birth control to support research in the area.

"Why do people love sex/gender norms?I was wondering if anyone has any info about why people want to adhere so strictly to sex/gender norms and divisions. I haven't read that much about it, but I assume it's a combo of tradition, defending one's identity (TERFs), and maintaining patriarchal power structures. What else? Am I wrong? Is there any reading I can do to inform myself about this topic? Edit: u/limelifesavers curious about what you think Edit: And why do people want others to adhere to gender standards? Why not let other people do what they want?"

I can see that. They dont have to fight the current. I guess I want to know why people actively defend these norms and divisions and why they're against other people breaking them.
"You nailed it, it's mostly about maintaining power structures -- your power over others, your groups' power over other groups. Gayle Rubin's essay ""Thinking Sex"" is a good exploration of this."
"Hey question, so does that mean gender norms probably don't exist in people as they are right now? Like in future feminist super society, how many people could you send back to now and have them fit in those neat categories? And when we say gender norms are we talking ""Oh that dude is a man, he's kind of nerdy, not interested in sports and kinda open emotionally but is still pretty much a dude, doesn't really violate many norms"" or are we talking ""That man provides for his family by building ships with his bare hands, votes Republican constantly and never cries. Even when his family died, he just started pumping iron""."
"Used in this context, a sex/gender ""norm"" has an element of social enforcement to it. It's not about what you are, it's about those boxes others try to put you in and classify you as good or bad based on how well you conform to the set of rules of the norm that has been applied to you. There isn't necessarily just one norm, there can be different norms enforced and approved by different groups. If you don't conform to the jock norm, maybe you can conform to the punk norm and you fit in there. We internalize the norms and use them to define ourselves and they also limit us and our expressions of who we are. In your example, you identified two different man norms, the first one is just a much softer norm. Generally the more strict, oppressive, and coercive a sex/gender norm is the worse it is, and all norms are at least a little coercive."
[deleted]
Oh okay. So it's why people do identify in those ways sort of strictly or that the very least aren't interested in violating them? Am I getting this right?

"This brings back memories of my ex so much. ""I wish someone would hug me and cuddle with me."" *Hey babe, I drove 44 miles after work to come to see you and cuddle!* ""WTF YOU ASSHOLE, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WOULD BE HERE!! WHY ARE YOU HERE UNANNOUNCED! WTF WTF WTF INVASION OF PRIVACY!!!!!!!"""
\> I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home this is the part that stood out to me. if a girl can look at her watch and say hey man I need to get home while you're eating her pussy - you're not doing it right.
Yeah - this was after the incident though. The moment was fucking dead. Agree with you though.
"Could be worse, women usually get paranoid when it takes you too long to cum as they think they aren't turning you on"
That's I was fucking thinking. Take it as a damn compliment!
"I would soft next. Bang other chicks (abundance). Then when all is forgotten, hit her back up and try again. Shes just one girl. Dont waste your time trying to fix it. Just be like yeah I did and? Keep frame keep fuckin."
Yeah man - Completely right. Ego is definitely the enemy. Just gotta get back in the rhythm.
"so it's sometimes a turn on for a girl if she can make you cum super fast. she knows she turned you on so much that you just couldn't help yourself. the key is to not be a minute man on the next encounter and have her panting and gasping for air after making her cum intensely. she texted you again, so she's maybe up for the next round."
"You did fine. You get that to you have to not worry about your performance but you still don't believe it. Never worry about it ever again, case closed. (obviously always increase your sex skills though)"
You didn't play it off well enough. This shouldn't have been a big deal at all. It's not like you got all the way to the main event anyway. By not acknowledging it playfully and stammering through excuses you made it awkward. She's still interested if she's reaching out. No harm in setting something up.
"Update: Someone please help me I dont wanna be incel anymoreMy post from a couple of days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill/comments/gd66cx/someone_please_help_me_i_dont_wanna_be_incel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Thank you for all of the support. I didnt think Id get it. Ive posted on reddit so much for therapeutic reasons and met with a lot of hostility. I decided to just grow up and realise I was being an IDIOT. Ive had female friends, Ive got with girls in the past, I dont deserve this idiocy and neither do women or those around me. I am gonna change, but not to get laid or anything. Actually, I suspected that I wouldnt ever get laid and I literally didnt care - because I wanna love women not hate them, have a healthy mindset to benefit my happiness and those around me. However it turns out Im actually fairly cute - so fixing my mindset and being happy, I might actually attract a girl, if I am lucky. But if it dont: its okay. Im not entitled to anything and if I was never to meet another woman again in my life, I still dont want this hate and sadness in my heart. Thanks for all the replies and the many who private messaged me, which all of them were women bar one - which is just a great show of how kinda women can be and how diverse and different they are. Ive got friends, I was working out and continue to do so, I have hobbies but I wanna develop more, try out any sport I can once I get to college, go to college to better myself, all the while working on myself. I feel as if the past year of depression and suicidal thoughts are coming to an end - I have hope again. Thanks everyone"
"I'm glad you're leaving that ideology behind. You're so young, you got your whole life ahead of you. Letting go of the hate is the best thing you can do for yourself."
"Agreed. I was waiting for a girl to come along and save me. Im embarrassed. It was pathetic and I feel awful that I was so entitled and put so much standards on women, that theyre supposed to be perfect, and one should come along and save me. Disgraceful. Women are flawed, and there are bad ones - that doesnt mean they arent beautiful. I have to start seeing women as individuals. Respecting them and respecting myself. I probably will never get laid, as I havent done so already. Im not that special, girls dont have to date me or have sex with me. Rather than being bitter about it, and blaming women - Im learning that my mindset is harmful to me and those around me. So, Im content with never having sex or being with a girl, thats their choice to not want me: however, I will love women, not be so entitled and pathetic, and have a healthy mindset for MY happiness. I feel quite good about myself now :)"
"This is great! Im proud of you and happy youre getting out of your depression. I know it can be easy to backslide, however, so it might be good for you to block websites or subreddits like theredpill to avoid temptation. You dont want to get brainwashed by that propaganda again. Im rooting for you!"
"Thanks so much! Yeah, I'm starting to take charge now! Those guys are toxic losers who are miserable. I AM BETTER THAN THAT"
"I am not trolling you, but you should check r/askgaybros , it will give you a view that even if *women* are completely **taken out** of equations, relationship between humans are...complicated. The more you read the various posts there, the more you will see that bad and good things happened in relationships sans women too. (Well, there are also fag hags, aka women who seduces openly gay men, thinking that they can turn them straight. Just like 'those' guys who think that he can turn lesbian straight.) One of bestfriends of mine is a gay man and he often shared with me his dating and lovelife grievances. It is similar to some of what you've said in previous post, just change the gender to men. Well, except for pregancy related thing."
"Im glad youre embracing/striving for a paradigm shift in your beliefs. I dont know if you saw my comment on your last post about checking out hbomberguy, but I seriously think some of his videos addressing antifeminism can help you. My first boyfriend was a misogynist, although I was too nave to see it at the time, and his belief in false statistics and social issues really affected the way he treated me and other women in ways I dont think even he realized at the time. Antifeminist/incel/redpill ideology is harmful for both women AND men, as Im sure youve experienced first hand when it comes to potential feelings of self-loathing or anger. Deconstructing some of the things you believe because of your time in these communities will really help you in the long run, I think. I can always provide more recommendations as well, if you find any of this helpful. Good luck in your journey!"
Hbomber guy? What does he say? Any videos in particular
"He does general commentary videos, some of which are responses to redpill/incel ideas. Two videos that come to mind are Pick Up Artisty: A Measured Response and Antifeminism vs Facts. Additionally, if hbomberguy doesnt really float your boat, maybe watch some of Vaushs videos on the incel community. (Many will pop up if you type in Vaush incel in the YouTube search bar.) You really dont -have- to watch anything, but I do think it could be beneficial for you in deconstructing your past beliefs. Another good thing might be counseling or therapy, if you live in a place where health insurance covers those things. Also, if youre planning on going to college, many universities will offer a few free counseling sessions every quarter. :) hope that helps"

"Neologism: Apex Fallacyhttps://www.logicallyfallacious.com/questions/D2RZISrj/apex_fallacy_what_is_it_wiki_page_deleted.html A subtype of composition fallacy.

Here's where intersectionalism comes in handy. There isn't only one system of power in place at any given time. What you're lacking in this analysis is class.
"Can you guys clarify what you mean when you say dont chase women?Okay so I can understand putting your career, money, fitness all ahead of women. Getting a mission in place. Lets say I wake up at 5 am to workout, go to work and end at 5 pm. Then I go do BJJ for a couple hours and then go home , eat, read and bed. Am I to expect that women are magically going to appear in my life? And even if one did, is this this lifestyle shes going to be even interested in? Just trying to understand this better. Thanks"
If you can can be high SMV and talk to a high SMV woman without a hint or neediness or thirst because you truly dont give a flying fuck you are not chasing. It shows in your body language and woman will be gawking at you at the gas station. Dgaf attitude is the key to life
Dont chase one woman or make women your whole goal. Pick up chicks as a side thing. I think a more accurate saying is put minimal effort into chasing women and dont waste your time with uninterested ones.
"Don't take it too literally. Obviously you need to initiate conversations with girls. What ""don't chase"" means, is don't do all the work and go overboard. If you talk to a girl at a bar, start with general banter, and make sure you and her have some back and forth that can lead to more physical escalation. Chasing is when you put the girl before everything. It means you are always the first to text her, you're always checking up on her, you reinitiate everything always. She needs to feel you might not text her, she needs to have space from you. You need to make sure she is doing something. When you do all the work, you are ""forcing"" it to workout. She needs to organically want to also reciprocate. The idea of ""chasing women"" is a bit broad, maybe you could expand on the context."
"You will never be high enough SMV to have 8+'s go after you (which I'm assuming are the type of girls you're trying to attract). Ask girls out and use game, but a) don't fixate yourself on one particular girl unless you're in an LTR and b) put girls behind your career, important extracurriculars, etc.."
"No, women aren't going to magically appear in your life. You need to go out and talk to them when you're out and about. Next time you go out doing shopping or whatever, just strike up a conversation with a few girls you find attractive. No need to go out of your way or change your schedule up just for women. You just do it on the side when you're already out doing stuff. If you're into online dating, just swipe while you're sitting on the toilet or eating a meal. Doesn't have to be more than 5 minutes a day. You're overthinking things if you're at the point where you're wondering if she'd be even interested in your lifestyle. You're the prize, it doesn't matter. A woman who is interested in you will make it work to be with you. She'll want to be a part of your lifestyle as it is. If you meet a girl and then change everything in your life to be with her, she'll most likely leave. A woman wants to add to your life, she doesn't want to BE your life."
"Bro, weve same lifestyle but I daygame too on weekends"
"It's about energy, if they are running away, trust it, chasing is weak. When they are moving towards you, push back, there you can feel your strength... match their energy. Play."
there is a huge difference between approaching and chasing..
"Your social life needs to be on point, you must make yourself a popular guy. That is being open to opportunities. If you sit on your ass, women are not going to fall into your lap. This whole mindset works in conjunction with being high-value and living high-value. An attractive lifestyle is what's gonna get women chasing you. Hard to do that if you work a 9-5."
Lingerie Brand Featuring Male Model Shut Down Haters on Instagram
"[This](https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/V7i9fm1MU/2160x1131/4-lingerie-brand-1588699680659.jpg) seems confidently stated, it would be a shame if it was a bluff, and offered without evidence. Same with this really: >""Men dont dress for women to find them attractive. They dress so other men do not hurt them."" The article has a very ""yaas, preach"" vibe."
"> ""Men dont dress for women to find them attractive. They dress so other men do not hurt them."" Do you think there is any truth to that, or total rubbish?"
"I'm erring on the side of strong disbelief there in a general sense. If fear of same-sex violent reprisal is highest on the list of priorities when picking out an outfit, I'd be very surprised."
"Pretty much total rubbish. Some might sometimes avoid dressing certain ways to avoid being hurt, but i don't think most of us are interested in going out in s pink tutu and sparkly tights anyways."
"As a male, who's been one my entire life: Total bullshit. I dress because I like to wear nice clothes. And I enjoy the attention I get from women. (Been told I'm fairly good looking, been cat called on the street many times, always a good laugh) I have no interest in makeup or wearing dresses or lingerie. Men don't need sycophants like this pushing their narrative into our lives. Most men don't wear make up or lingerie for a lack of desire. **And that's ok**. Maybe we should let men define masculinity as they see fit, without the input of women/feminists trying to reshape/redefine it to suit their interests. Masculinity should exist to suit **MEN**, THAT's emancipation."
"Given that it's the statement of an anonymous twitter user, who might not even be expressing an opinion based on their own lived experience... And given that my lived experience does not line up with it... I'm going to lean towards calling it 'total rubbish'"
Rubbish. And a really bizarre notion.
"Total rubbish. More often than not I just ware whatever is available because no body complain or care about it (jeans and a black/navy blue tee, because that's what I buy, I like it and doesn't impact in no shape or form my work), but when I feel facy I use suits and what not because I'm seen as taller (just better posture) and muscular (there's not much to hide like in my regular tees). It is definily nice to hear women complementing my look but unless there's an extra on the line I can simply brush off as a misunderstanding or whatever anyway."
"The main reason men dress the way they do is not because of a direct fear of backlash from others, but because they've already internalized male fashion norms, and they don't care to challenge these norms. The other responses illustrate this - ""we don't want to wear makeup/lingerie anyway"" is the overwhelming consensus. ""Men dont dress for women to find them attractive. They dress so other men do not hurt them."" I take issue with this for a couple reasons. 1. Men absolutely do dress and behave in a way they think will attract women. Currently, most women are not willing to date gender non-conforming men, and that will have to change in order for straight men to be willing to stray from gender norms. 2. Women are just as capable of hurting people as men are, and women are just as active in policing male gender norms as men are."
"I get looks all the time. How do I convert that to action?I even get a look with a smile sometimes. Mostly because I have a killer ripped body. Unfortunately Im not good at converting that into a hookup. Im definitely not a player. I dont have a lot of confidence in my facial looks. My face is ok, but it doesnt match my body in the sense that my body is a 10 and my face is a 7/8."
"If they look and smile, in their language, it means ""please approach me"" ... smile back and make your move."
I tend to agree with the look with a smile. I get more looks alone. By look I mean an obvious checking me out look.
I'm the exact same. Once this quarantine shit is over it's all gonna change
What do you mean how just fucking talk to them... yes its that easy
"Do not start the conversation to have sex or, at least, appreciate that one is the possible consequence of the other. In this perspective, you should not be anxious about the outcome of the interaction. It's like going to the casino: you can gamble a little money to spend an evening, watch a show or you can gamble because you need to pay the rent. The two scenarios are totally different. In the latter case you would be very, very anxious about the outcome of the evening."
"Make eye contact, smile back, walk over and say hi"
"You going introduce yourself or just stare? Followed by another quick smile, and by the come over hand motion"
"I swear no girl looks at me, whenever I try to make eye contact I see them actively looking away."
"When you get an IOI, just smile and walk over then make a comment about some random observation. Just think in your head, she is the one trying to get your approval."
"17 year old boy commits suicide after rape accusation. Her response: If he couldn't the handle the pressure, it's not her fault."
Eh? Hate against men much?
How the fuck can people have that much hate in them it just baffles me why people fake rape accusations even if the guy is proven innocent HIS ENTIRE LIFE WILL BE RUINED
"poor guy. This situation in which women have unconditional freedom to, without proof, accuse a man of rape and therefore ruining his life must change. False rape accusations must be considered crime, so that way the woman thinks twice before doing so."
This is so fucked up.

Law needs to punish such people who blackmail to complain without any proofs. She needs to be punished.
Watching teachers be kinder to the pretty/popular kids and meaner/bully the ugly/less popular kids was suifuel.
Ooh I know that feeling. I was mostly ignored by my teachers at school. Was even worse at uni. Might of well just been an empty chair for the amount of attention the lectures gave me..
"It's embarrassing when teachers seem to be more interested in being liked by the popular kids than doing their job and teaching...I guess they were the extroverted popular kids when they were in school so to them it's like a holy tradition to keep the undesirables in their place. They don't really give a fuck about most of their students, just the popular favorites they see themselves in."

It's almost like they are trying to re-live their school days and trying to fit in again smh
"Had a fifth grade teacher who used to encourage the other kids to bully me to make me tougher. A woman too. Teachers, man."
"Holy shit, the same thing happened to me, but I was in primary school at that time. She is still teaching, unsurprisingly. I love the education system."
"I had a middle school teacher like this. She was so mean to me because everyone else was. And she was the ""cool"" teacher who would crack jokes and so the kids really liked her."
"My teachers were generally pretty kind to me -- because I was a star pupil with a genuine love for learning and a creative, out-of-the-box perspective on just about every topic. HOWEVER, when I was bullied in class, they would do nothing to stop the bullies from picking on me. When I complained, they told me that without proof there was nothing they could do. One day, in 7th grade, I brought a tiny recording device (this was in the late '90s, when dinosaurs walked the Earth and smart phones were not yet a given), and used it to record my bullies' merciless insults during our group lab. I planned on using the recording as proof of my suffering so maybe the teacher could intervene. Unfortunately I became upset and let the head bully know I was recording him. He immediately told the teacher I was recording him and the teacher, with an apology, confiscated my device. There was another time in 6th grade where my bully was punished, but I was punished for my reaction to the bully. The bully in question publicly and loudly accused me of m""\*%$\*@$ing in the bathroom during an indoor recess held in the gym, and I left school right then and there, riding my bike home in the snow to escape the humiliation. My bully received 3 after-school detentions for her action, and I received a single day of in-school suspension (I got to do all my schoolwork and homework privately in school, and then read all day, not that much of a punishment). There was also the time some idiot etched a b@mb threat across the bathroom walls in 9th grade, and a few bully types decided to accuse me. I was, of course, called into the school psychologist's office and questioned. And of course when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts resulting from years of bullying to that same school psychologist, I was sent to a hospital for a suicide risk assessment. Same after the 11th-grade ""Project Love"" anti-bullying seminar, in which I publicly announced the division between school-aged ""Predators"" and ""Prey Animals"" and theorised that merciless bullying by the stronger ""Predators"" was a subconscious attempt to convince the less popular among the population to off ourselves, culling the herd until only the more desirable folks remained. My uni profs also rather loved me, with one or two exceptions where I just wasn;t invested int he class...but then again, most of my uni profs were not supermodels. It almost seems that altogether, my teachers were on the kinder end of the spectrum. Was I just lucky, or was this a side effect of attending school in the long-ago '90s and '00s?"
Do yall wear cologne?Simple question but Im curious. Ive never worn cologne although most of my friends wear it to parties (Im in college). It just seems way too expensive imo but maybe its worth it. What do yall think?
"Yes dude... Women notice. I will literally have friends' wives, sisters, mother's, etc. comment ""woah you smell so good"". All women love a man who wears cologne. Doesn't have to be fancy and certainly not expensive. Just go for something pleasant but not overpowering. I wear Polo Red and Acqui De Gio. Definitely musk up for any formal occasion, 'party' or social gathering of any kind where women will be present"
"Yes, go buy one. They don't have to be too expensive but your scent is important in order to be attractive in general. If you're at a job interview and smell like rat ass you're most likey not going to be hired, same goes for friends, girls and so on. Your hygiene is important, don't smell"
Don't forget to apply that shit properly. Nobody wants to swim in your cologne.
A good cologne should last pretty long and doesnt cost much annually. Stick to 3 and that has become my identity. Women will notice and some will make a move to come closer and sniff you.
"Versace Dylan Blue, not crazy expensive. But man women love it"
"Get CDNIM, it's the clone of a very famous and expensive fragrance called Aventus. They smell very similar, almost no difference at all for one tenth of the price."
I wear it because I like it.
I happen to like Cremo's scents. They're not overly expensive and I've gotten nothing but compliments.
Yes.

"Feminists discussing possible ""real"" explanations for why so many men have started coming forward about being sexually assaulted since it can't be that they were actually assaulted. Leading theories: it's trendy and they're lying to distract from real (female) victims"

Mmmm no it's not otherwise they'd look into our issues and try solving them instead of just completely ignoring them and stopping us from talking about them.
My comment may have been a touch tongue in cheek.
OK. Sorry then.

"It's worth pointing out that the focus of the piece is more on YouTube's censorship of the video in question than the video itself. Though it's not too surprising, given the existing policy of ""[\[removing\] any content that goes against the word of the controversial World Health Organization](https://reclaimthenet.org/youtube-ceo-coronavirus-right-information-misinformation/)."" Also, this: >Wittkowskis perspective is one that is increasingly the opinion of a growing section of the population and is the official perspective of the Swedish governments response to the pandemic but also one thats not allowed on YouTube. ***And as YouTube is the most dominant platform in online video, they have a massive ability to steer public conversation and perception.*** > >***While not everyone agrees with the perspective of Wittkowski, does it mean no one should be allowed to hear it?

"I can't believe how censorious YT is about the caronavirus because of ""misinformation"" when the fucking *experts* are clueless. WHO was either so incompetent, or lied, that they reported human transmission was impossible. Then they say wearing a mask doesn't help; cue wearing a mask being fucking *mandatory* in some places! Not only that but then you have the model that predicted 2 million deaths. I don't know the guy's name but I also heard the same person has been wrong. Every. Single. Time. He predicted deaths for swine flu and the like and was way off. At this point why should anyone trust experts? Especially when the response to the virus has become completely partisan?"
"The apologists and the censors think they're ""defending"" the integrity of experts and the idea of listening to them. Instead, they're not only cheapening that idea, but dissuading people from precisely that."
Isn't the point of having models at this point so that we can make them wrong though? It's like X deaths if we don't do Y. Predictions about number of deaths affect response which affects the final number of deaths.
Wouldn't prediction models have those variables in mind? Not to mention that response doesn't affect death tolls as much as the virus' inherent lethality.
"I haven't actually looked at the models you're referring to, but there's something inherently fucky about this kind of self-modeling, like how election models are always going to be fucked because people change their behavior (which the model was based on) depending on the model's output. And the lethality of any virus is directly tied to behavior."
Big no to that last sentence if this virus is anything to go by

Cockroach, here is quite a character, and she's even called for violence against a woman who was a victim of FGM when she lived in an Islamic state.

"> The suit, she said, challenges Title IX regulations that will redefine sexual misconduct in narrower terms as misconduct ""so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive"" that it ""denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity."" (The definition comports with how the Supreme Court regards sexual harassment.) > But Tabacco Mar argued that it creates a ""double standard"" for how schools must treat sexual discrimination complaints compared to how they handle allegations of racial, national origin and disability discrimination. That's interesting. I don't really hear about abuses of racial, national origin, and disability discrimination processes. At least at the student level. That seems to usually be administration or faculty. I assume those have already been to Supreme Court. This seems to be implying that (a) the Court sees them differently and (b) they should be treated the same."

"You are never going to get the reassurance of the subjective experience of others. I'm married and I've been with my partner for a decade. Is he with me because I make incredible lasagna? Because he loves me in a cosmic, unchangeable way? Because he wants me in a lustful way? Because I was convenient? Well, yes. All of that, at times, and probably more reasons. I honestly have no idea most of the time. A decade-long thing doesn't last on lust alone. So it's a bit of everything, I'm guessing, but I really have no way of measuring his subjective experience of me. So, for my peace of mind, I don't really try to do that. I am not, inherently, interested in how his brain engages with his choice to be married to me, it's just not that important. I can't know it, it wouldn't change anything material about my experiences with him, and it really is none of my business anyway. Other people's experience of me isn't my business. All I can control, all I have power over, is how I am treated and what kinds of experiences I want in my life. That's it. I can solicit behaviors, I can reject behaviors, but ultimately that's all I can sway. My husband treats me like he loves me in a cosmic way. He treats me like he wants me sexually. He treats me like I make great lasagna. And sometimes he treats me like a fixture in his life he doesn't have to question and can just rely on automatically, which I appreciate since I do it too. His behavior matches with my internal set of expectations for how someone who loves me would behave, and he says he loves me, so that's good enough. I don't really need to interrogate if what I think about as love and what he thinks of as love are identical experiences or motivated for the right reasons. The experience of being loved by him *is* acceptable, so that's good enough. All anyone can do is tell you and show you their truth. If they tell you they want you and they show you they want you, that's as much as you'll ever get. If they tell you they respect you and they treat you respectfully, that's all you'll ever get. All you can do is set expectations about what level of commitment, love, and respect is required for you to be intimate with someone and go from there. You get to set your expectations for how you want to be treated and people can meet them or not. You further decide to put up with it or not. For now, in human history, you're never going to get to look behind the curtain and see someone's real motivations, to experience their reasoning and desire, to get capital 'T' Truth on how they feel about you. Self-esteem is a real kick in the teeth on this one. It is the force that informs you when you're being tolerated as opposed to cherished. It's what tells you that your subjective experience of your beauty is the only thing that matters, that evidence of someone's lust must be a lie. If you hate yourself, you'll never believe that the words and behaviors you're experiencing are truthful because, how could they be? And, really, no one will ever be able to tell you differently because that's the entire toolbox at their disposal. But that's not their failing to impart their truth, that's your inability to read it and accept it. As a result, a lot of people only accept people with nasty, cruel behaviors and words because that feels more real, somehow, or at least offers up something believable. Swing a dead cat and you'll probably hit someone willing to treat you badly and confirm your bad self-assessment. So, yeah, in the most obnoxious way possible, a lot of this comes down to fixing your own internal metrics for the expectations you set, the behaviors you'll tolerate, the evidence you'll find convincing. Which just...sucks. Because that's hard, painful work that takes a long time to internalize. But doing it makes everything so, so much nicer."
A well written and thoughtfull response!!
Bald men can be sexy. My partner is bald and I wouldnt wish for him to change. Baldness is a sign of high testosterone. But personality is important. Whats wrong with being someone because of their personality. If youre going to live a long time with someone and spend every day with them wouldnt you want them to have a shining personality and not be weird or ruin things with their constant unneeded insecurity? Insecurity is a huge killer of libido and relationships. Theres nothing less sexy than being interrogated by an insecure person because you said a person on tv looked nice.
"I think you should do what makes you feel good before you try to predict what other people might have thought about you. Your problem here is that you feel unattractive because you are balding. Do you think that if you were a gay male, you will not feel the same thing? Work on the baldness. Saved up for hair transplant surgery. do not feel bad for doing it. People should do things that make them feel better. Double eyelids surgery, underbite surgery, nose surgery, etc. You will feel better after, when you have done something positive for yourself first and foremost."
"I was hoping to go the acceptance route. The hair transplant surgeries are very expensive, they leave a nasty scar, and you need to take drugs the rest of your life to maintain the donor hair. If anything, Worst comes to worst, I would get a realistic hair piece. Much cheaper and I dont need to get my head cut open."
"Just shave your head, dude. It's a good look."
"You have to learn to trust that women are capable of making their own decisions, that those decisions are healthy. Sure there are people who make bad decisions, but that's not the point. This isn't about women. It's about you. I kinda doubt that this is really about your hair at all. That's just the easy thing to grab onto and obsess over. Let go of your need to look on others as lesser, in this case women, to make yourself feel better. Stop thinking of them as solely superficial. Let go of that need to exert control over others. Focus on the things you *can* control. Remember: your kneejerk emotional reaction to things is how society has conditioned you to react, think, and believe. How you react to *that* determines who you are. Don't listen to the intrusive thoughts, either. I sincerely suggest you speak to a therapist, and possibly investigate body dysmorphia."
">You have to learn to trust that women are capable of making their own decisions, that those decisions are healthy. Sure there are people who make bad decisions, but that's not the point. This isn't about women. It's about you. Or how about this: Women are capable of making their own decisions. Some of those decisions are healthy, and some of those decisions definitely aren't. But when women make those decisions, it's not about you it's about *them*. TRP is based on certain particular types of women that guys like the OP should avoid at all costs. I'm talking in particular about highly impulsive women with narcissistic traits."
"You dont. You accept it and try to become what women want, assuming you want to be attractive to women. Im shallow and Ive accepted that. I think most men are. Were mostly attracted to looks. So I understand if womens attraction to me is shallow. What does it mean to be attracted to you? What do you want a woman to be attracted to? What defines you? And why do you want a woman to be attracted to that?"
"How to handle intimacy changes due to Covid-19 at my man's request**(Update: We talked about it, and as it turns out we were both waiting for the other person to say they felt okay with the boundary being dissolved. This sounds so silly now, but I guess me asking him if he still wants something doesn't communicate how I feel about it. He can't look after my needs properly if I don't tell him how I feel. We're resuming the intimacy as we're both on the same page about what's safe for us, problem solved!)** My boyfriend and I have been together for \~9 months, and we love each other. The last time we saw each other ""normally"" before things got serious in our state (e.g. lockdowns began) was in mid-March. Since then, I have been at his place one time (toward the end of March) because he lives with his father at the moment, and they both have been vigilant about not allowing anybody else at the house. Both of them have been able to return to work safely as of the second week of May. We're still seeing each other on the weekends, like clockwork -- just in my part of town, or at an outdoor midpoint we can both get to such as a state park. And fortunately, no one in either of our social circles has tested positive, and neither have we. The main struggle I'm having is this: Since mid-March, at his request, we have not kissed on the lips/made out. Our intimacy has not gone past hugging or cuddling, and even then it's not prolonged. Keep in mind, we had not gone past making out ever in our relationship, mainly because both of us have been moving slowly for our own reasons. I am big on giving and receiving physical touch, particularly through physical intimacy, so to have this part of our relationship almost disappear for two months has been really hard for me. I know he's having a hard time too for the same reason, but every time I've asked him what he thinks, he's stated that he doesn't like having this boundary, but he hasn't changed his mind. My question is: I've never once nagged him or tried to manipulate him into changing his mind about this. I know he's just using his judgment to try and keep me safe, since he's told me that he's more worried about spreading the virus to me (his county has way more cases than mine). I've known him for almost a year before we got together, and I do trust him: He's not abusive or controlling or on some power trip by shutting kissing down. And I know that once things calm down, and he feels we're both safe enough, our physical intimacy will come back with a fury. **But I've never been in a healthy LTR for this long. So I've never really had a relationship before where I have to trust a man unconditionally with a temporary change that (1) I'm chafing against like crazy, and (2) don't how long I'll have to go along with. This, I think, is the root of the issue. As a RPW, what should I do?**"
"> I know he's having a hard time too for the same reason, but every time I've asked him what he thinks, he's stated that he doesn't like having this boundary, but he hasn't changed his mind. > I've never once nagged him or tried to manipulate him into changing his mind about this. Something doesnt add up here.... You wont die if you dont get a kiss for another couple of months, but youll kill your relationship if you dont drop this issue."
Im not sure whats unclear is politely asking him every couple of weeks what he thinks and if we should still continue with this boundary considered nagging?
Yes.
Sounds like this is a good example of STFU even when its hard. Ive got the message. And thanks for being so prompt!

He can't reasonably expect you to not kiss him for months on end, even a year or longer. I commend you for going as long as you have and for the level of respect that you've been showing him. Good job! If he understands how you feel and still insists on the no-kiss/hug policy, ask him how long does he anticipate it to last. What exact guidelines is he going off of? Is it purely what makes him feel safe, his emotions, or is he basing his decision off facts? Is he deducing or listening to other people? Your action will depend on the answers. I would not want to continue a relationship with someone who's paranoid. I would not want to continue a relationship with someone who easily believes what others say. I would want to be with an intelligent, healthy person who questions just about everything and verifies information before drawing to conclusion and especially before making a decision that involves or affects other people."
Lol I told the same thing to my boyfriend and we only lasted few days from not kissing. Can't keep our hands to ourselves Like 2 months is too long. There is something going on in his mind or he is really extremely paranoid.
"I think everyone is handling things differently. I have family who are taking many more precautions than me, even though I am pregnant and this is quite a scary time for me. I have family members who are higher risk and have decided to take less precautions than me. My fiance and I are the only two members in our household, so we've decided what precautions we feel are reasonable, where we can have a little wiggle room. I have had people try to change the way we were doing things one way or another, wanting me to be more or less cautious. I feel like that is incredibly disrespectful honestly, given the times we live in. Boyfriend, family, whoever, don't bother someone to go against safety measures in the midst of a pandemic ffs."
"Covid can be spread by touching surfaces. If he breathes on you, you can get it. If he breathes on anything in your house, you can get it. Unless youre maintaining 2 meters of physical distance at all times in a public place, youre at risk. If youve been cuddling, you might as well kiss too. Id suggest finding a way to try to explain this to him, that not kissing doesnt lower the risk of transmission if youre cuddling. If he still doesnt want to, fine. Never bring it up again and respect his final decision. You shouldnt bring something up multiple times like you said you did, because that counts as nagging even if youre just asking. Youre repeatedly questioning his judgement and communication skills. If he changed his mind, he would tell you. You have to trust him to communicate that to you."
"If it is something you feel so strongly about that you made a reddit post, then I think you need to have a serious conversation with him about how you feel. A captain is going to lead with his crews interest in mind - let him know what yours are."

I'm starting to wonder if we'd be better off without the DMCA.
"IDK, maybe it needs something doing to it to allow platforms to disregard DMCA claims from known false flaggers and ban them from using the process without opening themselves up to liability?"
"You could put some teeth in punishing false reports; however, that would just cause an endless stream of shell corps. And punishing the company they're 'speaking for' would result in troll reporting by 'rogue agents'. Best thing to do is burn it down; we already *have* (shitty, Mouse-engineered) copyright laws; no need to slap more on top of."
"By mouse we mean Disney? If so, it would have been even funnier if you said Mouse-Imagineered *not throwing shade on imagineers unless they got infiltrated as well*"
"Wed be better off without the disneyfyed copyright system (life of the author + 70 years) and a significantly reduced patent system (ideally Just more than long enough to get a solid head start on production and distribution) The entire point of patents is to eliminate secret recipes and let valuable information and creations become public information. As of now it serves to enforce monopolies on technology that should be democratized ie.cancer treatments!?!?! As for copyright should Mark Twains autobiography and Yes! we Have no Bananas, really only become freely available this year? Even if you take into account the creators children why do we have to pay crazy inheritance taxes yet they still get full reign over ancient creative works?"
"It's a process that shouldn't be so automated. Creating a process that dissuades fake DMCA claims should be the first step in eliminating those who seek to abuse it. The problem is they simply don't care enough. They're always more than willing to let these problems continue until they become public knowledge. They make *zero* effort to preemptively prevent this type of abuse across all of their platforms. As long as they get their money, what do they care; especially if it benefits them with certain content being removed."

"Gender wage gap...When I (29, F) first started dating my boyfriend (45, M) two years ago, I informed him it was important to me that my partner be feminist-minded like me. He said that he'd ""better become a feminist"" then. I know the meaning can be unique for certain people, but these last few months in quarantine have revealed to me that his political views are really different from mine. After making him dinner (again), we got into a heated argument on the gender wage gap. He doesn't get that (despite being illegal), female counterparts are paid (on average, counterparts meaning those colleagues in identical roles) less than their male counterparts. And now I am starting to doubt myself... Yes, women have historically taken on lesser-paying professional roles, which is what my partner was arguing. I get that. But from what I've learned, it goes beyond that. If anyone could help me to find the evidence to support this, that would be much appreciated (info pertaining to wage gap between male/female employee counterparts, and yes I am aware of the difference that negotiating salary makes during initial hire and re-evaluating periods). Thanks in advance!"

"You linked my post to the wage gap question? I know its lame, but I'm actually touched/proud of that."
I link it all the time!
Sorry that you are quarantined while you find these things out about your partner. I wanted to add that [training women to negotiate hasn't turned out to be much of a remedy.](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/leadership-skills-daily/women-and-negotiation-leveling-the-playing-field/) The reason the gaps persist is because of how deeply entrenched beliefs about [the value of women's work are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_L._Ridgeway)\-- as soon as work gets [coded as being 'for women' the average salaries will drop](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/paper/26zNEQ4i) (even for men that work in that industry).
Thanks so much! These are very useful and insightful (despite being sad). I hope we can continue changing for the better.
"Are there any studies that show there is a wage gap when adjusting for experience, education, and occupation? I'm legitimately curious because I found an article a while back saying that there isn't any evidence of this. The article about salaries dropping when women enter a field is easily explainable by supply and demand. Is there any evidence that it drops any faster than any other field with a large supply of labor? EDIT: I believe in the concept that women are more expected to go into careers that are lower paying."

"It doesn't address the structural societal issues, and hence, I think, underestimates the severity of the problem by presenting only numbers. (Case in point, my teachers might have said 'women's access to professional work has historically been limited by law and stigma to lesser-paying roles'.) Yet, if your partner is into statistics, and thinks that only the most comprehensive and up-to-date will do: [https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap) ""The controlled gender pay gap, which controls for job title, years of experience, industry, location and other compensable factors, has also decreased, but only by $0.01 since 2015. Women in the controlled group make $0.98 for every $1 a man makes. New to the gender pay gap report for 2020 is analysis on the impact of lost wages on lifetime earnings. By calculating presumptive raises given over a 40-year career, we find that women in the uncontrolled group stand to lose $900,000 on average over a lifetime. Lost earnings narrow to $80,000 for the controlled group, but this is still significant, especially if you consider how lost earnings due to the gender pay gap would grow with compound interest if invested each year for 40 years."" Also, as a man who's come a long way from where I once was - if you don't think that the housework is being shared equally but he does, 98 times out of 100 you're right. I was very good at confusing myself about the relative value of the work I was doing for the household, and advocating for my cockamamie logic. I was wrong, along with every other man I have ever met arguing that he really is contributing enough."

"Does anyone else have a hard time feeling empathy/sympathy for people who have committed sex crimes?I've recently decided I want to become a prisoner penpal (basically you write letters back forth with someone who is incarcerated and offer them friendship since many inmates lose contact with the outside) and in my research to find an inmate I feel comfortable writing letters to I'm discovering that I have a hard time feeling sorry for people who've been convicted of sex crimes relative to other serious crimes. I believe part of how I feel stems from how we as a society treat accusers and how horrifyingly often sex crimes go unpunished, to me sex crimes just seem far more heinous when compared to others even though I know that's not necessarily objectively true. Does anyone else struggle with the same feelings?"
"This is a bit of an odd question because you are assuming feminists try to have sympathy for people who have committed sex crimes? I mean why would I even want to do that when there is an actual victim needing our sympathy instead? You are feeling logically negative about a person who has done a bad thing. I'm curious though, which criminals do you feel sympathy/empathy for? Maybe those whose crimes have not harmed another person?"
"Thats a good question, I suppose I might be conflating sympathy with giving people second chances. I assume that most feminists are likely in favor of giving criminals a chance to rehabilitate themselves and reform their lives for the betterment of society including people who commit sex crimes. In my mind, though, its hard not to feel like the two cant coexist: like if we dont have some amount of sympathy for these people then they may never feel compelled to improve. I may be totally wrong though. As for other comparable crimes I meant like people who killed another person by accident, or trafficked illegal drugs. Obviously killing people is wrong and depending on where the drugs came from they may have been indirectly supporting other crimes such as human trafficking. I suppose its easier to feel sympathy for these people because either didnt mean to hurt someone else or they didnt directly commit a crime against another person, though logically I know that these crimes arent any less bad than sex crimes."
"I think you are conflating two different and not necessarily similar things. [For one, 'sympathy' is definitely the wrong emotion and you aren't obligated to feel or perform that when talking about restorative justice and sex crimes.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201505/empathy-vs-sympathy) Feeling sympathy implies/requires you to relate in some way with the circumstances or emotional state of criminal-- that's not necessary to want them to go through a restorative justice process, to be accountable for their crimes, to face appropriate consequences, or to even be humanely rehabilitated and eventually reintegrated into society-- you don't have to change your feelings about the crime or the criminal to know and act on the moral/philosophical belief that the criminal is a person with rights and feelings on the basis of their humanity. Neither your personal judgement nor your forgiveness is required for you to be in opposition to current prison conditions or consequences for certain types of criminals."
I don't. I feel bad for the emotional/psychological parts of people that have been hurt. I know there are are places that do rehabilitate sexual offenders and I'm not sure what exactly that sort of program looks like. That's a therapist's job - not mine.
"I suppose thats good way to look at it, like I should leave it to professionals to help these people and not feel bad that I dont feel compelled to help them myself."
"I think this is a very personal issue that is going to be different for everyone. I also think its difficult to weigh one persons crime against another and come to any clear conclusions about someone. I will say Ive never considered engaging with someone in the positions of the people you are considering, I might feel differently if I was. Im a believer in meeting people where theyre at in all areas of my life though. I think its possible for us to recognize the humanity in many offenders beings during or after their punishment. That said I also recognize there are some that will fall beyond help. But you should feel no obligation to put them on even footing when it comes to making your choice, especially if that means you would not be able to offer them the same kind of human connection the program is intended to provide. Your doing this to provide connection, you should pick someone you feel likely to be able to connect with."
"Your question reminds me of an episode of Invisibilia, give it a listen if you have some time, I found it to be very thought provoking. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/24/481859662/invisibilia-is-your-personality-fixed-or-can-you-change-who-you-are"
"I don't think one can give a blanket answer to this question. Personally, if someone is remorseful or if they recognize what they did is wrong, etc. then I think there's room for empathy. But in general I think it's harder to feel sympathy for them without context because it's impossible to conjure up reasonable explanations for their behaviour. Someone gets arrested for drugs? Maybe it was just a little weed and they were racially targeted. Someone is arrested for grand larceny? Maybe they fell in with a bad crowd and didn't have a choice. Or maybe they were pulling a robin hood and stealing from the rich. There are lots of crimes where you can manufacture justifications that give a bit of morality to their actions (even if that's not the case), but it's nearly impossible to conjure up any sort of moral explanation for a sex crime."
"I kinda get where you're coming from. There are certain situations where murder / manslaughter offends me less than sex crimes. Someone who finally snaps and kills their longtime abuser, or someone who committed murder as a juvenile and deeply regrets their actions, etc. I think it's a very commendable thing for you to do, and while I don't disagree with others about it not being your responsibility, I wish you were getting more encouragement."

"I first noticed this as a teen rewatching Titanic. They really emphasize women and children being more important. As a teen I realized: wait I'm turning into a young man, this means I'm no longer loved as that little boy. As a male we are less important to everyone around us. Besides ourselves. I've discovered not giving a shit about most people (especially women and children) and caring about myself more. Not in an extreme way or anything. Just knowing that I am the center of my experience in this reality, and I shouldn't give up anything I can gain to anyone else just because they're a kid or a woman. We as men are only as important as we make ourselves, because no one else is going to make us important for us. If that makes sense. Women and children are made important for just existing. This is why they require so much more attention and reassurance. They're addicted to validation."
"I reject that. I value all my MGTOW brothers as human beings regardless of whether they've accomplished anything or not. They're of value simply by being human beings. I also value ANY work that they do. I know our society looks down on jobs like garbage collector of fast food worker, but I see that as honest work and I respect anyone who does it. The fact that our society doesn't value all men and all work done by any man shows that our society is sick. Why is the work of a lawyer or a doctor valued, but the work of a janitor isn't? If all the janitors quit doing their work, we would notice that really fast! In short, men are undervalued. It's not a sign that men actually are of no value. It's a sign that our society is sick and fucked up. Yet, feminists throw a fit as if they're the ones who have it hard."

I had to identify the body since mine was person's last known address, indicating that person had been homeless the entire time or at least most of it.

How to double text? Don't give up too soonHi guys. I have been into seduction for a couple of years now. I am moderate by most standards. I know and read the most popular material (models etc.). And once in a while I stumble on a detail about game that I haven't figured out. In my first year I went by the 'hell yes hell no principle'. Thinking that if women flaked or did any sign of disinterest I moved on. But now I have more experience I start to notice that it isn't this straight forward at all. I had a date for example where the girl wanted to leave. I turned it around and had a f close. Same with reinitiating contact. Girl doesn't answer texts says she is busy but 2 months later we still hook up. I was far too negative. Having a short fuse to think women aren't into me by the first sign of trouble. Ofcourse if a girl is bothering me with her behavior I let it go. But if I am less insecure about it I just try again and to my suprise I often get what I want. So I am thinking about the double text. We are having a fun conversation. About equal investment. And than it stops. How do you approach this? Thx for reading guys. I am curious what you come up with.
"Honestly it doesn't cost anything to try some low-effort message that amounts to something like: ""Hey, it's been a while, what's up?"" The idea ain't to send some fancy-ass message or anything. Just trying to test the waters to see if she'll even bother to answer to that. If she does, great! You can try again where you stopped before. If she doesn't, it's unlikely she would have been interested anyway and you can move on without having to wonder if you should try again! Easier to do when you're having some success with other girls in the meantime and are outcome independent with this specific one."
That is a very generic boring message. I agree though that you can always try. When it comes to texting I always go by: never be boring Especially when initiating a conversation.
"I think it's important to give the girl enough space to re-initiate the conversation without letting your rapport die completely. What that looks like in practice, hard to say. If she stops replying I would definitely give her a couple of days to reach out, though. I think it's also important to note that girls are in different states at different times. If she's feeling social and wants to meet people at the particular time you're talking to her then she's likely to be more responsive than if you catch her at a time when she's worn down and wants to chill for a couple of weeks. Half the battle is catching her at a time when she's DTF."
"The hell yes hell no principle is just meant to make a better use of your time. The idea being why chasing a girl who has low interest when million others are potentially ready to jump on your D without any effort. However i concur that you shouldn't necessarily give up at the first sign of resistance. If she pulls away and back off from a date, shrug it off, put a 2 or 3 months timer on and wait for her to either contact you or the end of the timer where you can send a feeler text to see what she is up to. Still not available for date? no problem, reset the timer again If you keep repeating the process and that she had some interest initially it's very likely, you'll end up hooking up at some point"
Especially with 9-10s. If it fades with them or they ghost you after a date just hit them up 3-7 days later and invite them to do something fun. You'd be surprised about what you can turn around with some persistence and patience.
"My most recent girlfriend was like this, she just kept curving and curving, but you really have to play with your gut, some girls its pretty obvious shes just playing games, but with her, it was clear that she was just fresh out of a relationship, and scared of men, essentially. If a girl seems interested when you text her, but then leaves you on read after a while, understand that its either this, or in all likelihood, you arent the only guy she is talking to. (Shocker, I know.) I dont typically entertain girls who send one word replies, and then leave me on read after a while, in fact, Im usually the one who leaves the girl on read at this point, but if she is generally engaging, might be worth playing the long game. The best advice I can give though, dont double text on the same day, thats a mistake I made for a long time, and it was impulsive. It also helps to have them on multiple platforms, my last girlfriend for example, I finally got a first date with her through the Instagram DMs, and the rest is history."
"Dating is pretty stressful for everyone, girls might not have to approach or message first but they do have to sift through a lot of shit. She might have been busy with school/work/etc or maybe just unsure about you. Often they'll be flaky because their mental guard is up, is he insecure and will he get angry/ditch me after one slight? You lose next to nothing double texting in a few days later with a follow-up and it even shows you are just a chill and understanding person. The number of times I've heard a female friend say they aren't feeling it with a guy, only or them to be on a date with them days later is comically large."
Yes they always have moments they aren't feeling it with a guy.
Go for the phone call.
Im a male feminist and mens right activist just told me men and boys are more likely to be victims of assault. Is he lying?It was in the comments section of one of my YouTube videos about feminism. Edit: here is a screenshot [of the comment in question](https://imgur.com/a/fOXA9S1) Men are the most common victims of sexual assault. But no one cares what happens to men in prison so they?
"People say this all the time and I have yet to see any kind of proof or even the slightest hint of where this original idea may have come from. So yes, hes lying. Edit: Heres the first link I found regarding sexual assault in children https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens Second edit: Im not sure whether they meant assault or sexual assault. If its non-sexual assault, I think hes right but I huge portion of non-sexual assault in men is instigated by threats or general aggression (not saying they deserved it)"
"Men are absolutely more likely to be assaulted than women. Not necessarily sexually assaulted, but that's not the only form of assault."
"Was he talking about regular assault or sexual assault? Women are more likely to be victims of sexual assault. Men are more likely to victims of other types of crime like murder (since men are more likely to be involved in criminal activity). I remember seeing some meme about men being more likely to be victims of sexual assault because of prison rape, but the math was wrong."
"Yeah, there was this dude a while back who posted in a bunch of menslib type zones about how he had math to prove that men were sexually assaulted more, by women too, but his math didn't check out. He used cherrypicked data and statistical manipulation, mods usually dispelled the myths or removed the posts, and he moved on to weird manosphere zones with the same gimmick. So now that's kind of a thing they believe."
"> Men are more likely to victims of other types of crime like murder (since men are more likely to be involved in criminal activity). It would be super interesting if it were possible to adjust for all the ways women adapt to avoid assault. Like if we suddenly didn't have someone escort us to our cars, walked home alone late at night etc."
> Men are more likely to victims of other types of crime like murder (since men are more likely to be involved in criminal activity). Do you think most male murder victims were involved in criminal activity?
"He is not lying. Men are more likely to be physically assaulted than women. The most accurate source on this in Australia is the Personal Safety Survey, which for 2016 found: Lifetime: * Four in ten men (41% or 3.7 million) and three in ten women (31% or 2.9 million) experienced physical violence. Past 12 months: * For men the proportion experiencing physical violence was 5.4% in 2016. * For women, the proportion was 3.5% in 2016. In all cases it was more common for the assailant to be male. Please note that this is physical assault only and does not take into account stalking, sexual assault etc. where the disparity goes the other way. For boys it is unclear, but the same survey found that around one in six women (16% or 1.5 million) and just over one in ten men (11% or 991,600) experienced abuse before the age of 15.

"Men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes in general than women, particularly crimes perpetrated by a stranger. Women are more likely to be victims of sexual crimes and intimate partner violence. That might be where you've gotten the confusion: they were thinking violent crimes when they said assault, and you thought they meant sexual assault."
True incel?

I mean I can't really penalize him for this since it's why I hate most people if they are men or women.
This is remind me so much of that episode of Angel where they had to deal with that demon of misogyny.
"On the perception that feminism blames men for everything.This is a common sticking point and a common criticism of feminism coming from MRA-aligned people. Here is my best attempt to summarize the issue: Most feminists seem to believe that patriarchy and misogyny are the only valid lens through which to look at mens issues. The ideas of anti-male sexism and misandry are a taboo in feminism. Any double standards that seem to negatively affect men are rationalized as misogyny backfiring. If you talk about an issue where men get the short end of the stick (such as bias in child custody proceedings), feminists are quick to point out that, in fact, patriarchy is responsible for this. If you talk about how men are shamed for showing emotions (by both men and women), feminists are quick to point out that this is a result of misogyny that showing emotion is considered feminine and thus inferior. Therefore the blame falls on patriarchy again. To a non-feminist, this leads to the impression that feminists are blaming men (as a class) for all gender-based unfairness. In fact, the eagerness with which feminists blame patriarchy suggests that they think its very important that everyone understands exactly where the blame should lie (on men). Feminists, do you agree with the perception that you blame men, as a class, for most (or all) gender-based unfairness? Do you think that its important to acknowledge that the blame lies on men? Where do you think the balance falls between class-based and individual repsonsibility? Is it possible for feminists and progressive MRA's to reconcile this difference of opinion?"
"I feel like the way people on this subreddit define feminism requires me to not identify as a feminist while on this subreddit. I agree that there are a lot of feminists whose views are very shallow and kinda selfish. I don't really participate in mainstream feminist spaces or whatever, so I might be out of touch, idk. But I don't blame people who think that a lot of feminists are mean to men. I'm not smart or a social scientist, I don't read books by feminists or follow feminist twitter accounts, so don't ask me to defend this or that feminist figure. But I think that patriarchy isn't really men's fault. It's the fault of conservatism, maybe. Gender roles exist for a reason, but they're outdated now. The people who keep clinging to them and enforcing them unnecessarily include men and women, so it's not a men problem."
[removed]
"This is a good question OP... I hope we can get some feminists perspectives on addressing this, as there are feminists who do not think like this (sadly they are not the ones in power). Let me show a case in point: So what you said has real effects and is not just theory. For example feminists blocking the only ever male welfare officer at university in the ENTIRE UK. Making a campaign against him so he stepped down and it never went ahead: >Olivia Bailey, NUS national women's officer, said: ""Discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent, so what exactly will a men's society do?"" ""To suggest that men need a specific space to be 'men' is ludicrous, when everywhere you turn you will find male-dominated spaces,"" she added. I mean just one rebuttal to that is men are a minority in university. In education an example of flat out sexism and institutional sexism at an international scale (which she denies is): >Throughout the OECD Teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work to boys. Furthermore, a boy will receive 1/3 higher grade in reading tests if the teacher does not know he is a boy (OECD) From teachers give girls higher grades despite boys objectively getting higher test scores SOURCE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/) Someone with some sense: >As Sarah McCulloch, the female treasurer of the MENS society at Manchester puts it: ""It's important that everyone be included in the discussion about how to create a more equal and fair society, and I don't believe t**hat we will achieve true equality by allowing men to tag along with the women's liberation movement men have their own problems.""** So I have learned some feminists are critical of modern feminism and do actually not like this idea of unidirectional power dynamics with men being oppressors and women being victims and patriachy being responsible for womens individual actions (and mens)... this type of feminism needs to raise up and be the loudest voice because at the moment feminism has gone mad. I mean decreeing air conditioning is sexist, sleep is sexist etc."
"""The blame game"" implies that this is like a court or something, or a moral judgement of one's soul. I think its a mode people go into when they feel like a component of their identity is being judged. Like white people getting defensive about historical racism. What I think is meant is most cases is a critique of actions and a society that people inherited, and what people hear is that they're a bad person for being on the 'wrong side' when it's rarely that accusatory. More specifically, yes, men are and were in largely in charge of the cultural and political forces that have shaped our society. It's not a coincidence that capitalism is sold to society as fair competition on an even field."

">This idea of patriarchy is like a religious belief... me questioning it, actually means patriachy exists and I am a misongyst and need to check my privelage.... ahh see how it works, and how it shelters itself for critisicm. Do you need any of my input here or are you happy just making up stuff?"

"> More specifically, yes, men are and were in largely in charge of the cultural and political forces that have shaped our society. Personally I think the time of men holding almost all of the cultural power is long past. We're left with the legacy of patriarchy, but each of us, as an individual, can choose to perpetuate it, or to fight it. This is a fight that men and women are a part of equally. It just feels odd to me that when men's issues are brought up in feminist spaces, there always needs to be the caveat that ""men made it this way"". Why is that so necessary to bring up? Why the need to always take anti-male sexism and re-label it as misogyny? Even if misogyny may have played a part in the formation of a gendered double standard (which personally I would dispute in certain cases), men are suffering from it now. It feels almost like it's intended to downplay the very real struggles men face, or suggest that men alone are responsible for fixing them."
"A vast majority of social progress for women came about during WW2 . That's history, but not ancient history. >It just feels odd to me that when men's issues are brought up in feminist spaces, there always needs to be the caveat that ""men made it this way"". As I said, I think that's you feeling blamed rather than it being an act of blaming. Pointing to the history is useful because you can appreciate the steps it took to get to a certain place and which tactics were effective. It also opens a window into what aspects still needs progress. >Why the need to always take anti-male sexism and re-label it as misogyny? A lot of male sexism is about living up to a patriarchal male ideal."
Some balance to how we look at history
"They might be unwilling to marry, but I've known boyfriend/girlfriend couples where the woman works and the guy smokes weed, plays Call of Duty and Madden, and smokes more weed. I guess they think they can reform Chad or something."
Tbh that's awesome and I'm going for that.
"There were no bachelors? Men could live by themselves because they could both be home and work. Women were not allowed to be hired, or even have a savings account. Being married was not required either."
"> Women were not allowed to be hired, or even have a savings account. Cite?"
"That's BS. Single women could work or own property. Even married women could own property, despite the fact that her husband was legally responsible for providing for her, and for taking care of any debts she creates."
"If they were single, they were allowed those rights. If they were not single they were not allowed to work only without husband permission, and not allowed to hold land capital, but they were given the privilege of not being able to incur debt on themselves, and to have a right to be provided for by their husbands without any duty to work themselves."
I'm sure brothels hired many single women back in the day.
Men also had to fight wars and women didn't
"Suicides in England and Wales rise by 'deeply concerning' 11 per cent with 4,620 deaths in 2019 - 77% of victims were male"
What do they expect. Men still have all the burden of being men but now they get shamed in almost every way possible to go along with it. There is still little recognition for men's suffering.
"""Women most affected"" -mainstream media"
"""shockingly 1 in 4 were female, how do we stop this female suicide crisis"""
You really understand how to get to the heart of the problem good lad
Maybe we should stop taking 40-60% of their income and then throwing them in jail when they cant afford to pay anymore.
What do you mean by taking their income?
"Let's take a plus side of this article, they actually labelled some good reasons why its higher! About time daily-fail used some facts"
"If these figures were reversed and suicides were 77% women, the world would stop. It would be declared a global crisis, governments would implement new policies overnight, hundreds of support networks would pop up, Bono would do another Live Aid and every company in the world would run a fundraising campaign to donate to the cause. But because its men, like, who gives a fuck lol."
"More lemmings die than men each year, and some of them will be female where is your compassion for them bruh?! You need some lessons in true cross-species feminism, remember now kids, say it with me - ""all men must be raped and killed"""

"Cue the feminists: this is actually sexism against women, because they are forced into a nurturing role by the patriarchal society, and there by only seen as mothers and nothing else"
The assumption that women are naturally better caretakers is part... OF THE PATRIARCHY!
Thats what Ive heard before. It gets brought up when you talk about why women get custody of children more than men. Also the gender stereotypes that are pushed onto women by patriarchal society. Am I sounding like a feminist now?

"I think that would be rude not to thank them, your ex can't really contact you with a thank you card so i think you should send it ! And maybe cut off all contacts after this if it would make you feel safer"

"Yes send it, but make no mention of future plans or him or the relationship"
Thank you!!!
"Wow OP, Im really sorry to hear about your brother. My father had schizophrenia which was mostly managed until the final years. Its heartbreaking on so many levels to have a loved one with this illness. Please feel free to reach out if you need to talk."
"Thank you so much for this kind note. My brother was determined to be more schizoaffective, and hes still not doing well, but hes on a lot of medication. It makes me sad because of his bright future thats gone. He was top of his class at a difficult university, and now he can barely get out of bed."
"Im sorry to hear about your brother. My college boyfriend experienced something similar (brilliant charismatic college junior, had a sudden mental break, diagnosed with bipolar 1 with paranoid delusions) and it was really rough for him for awhile. Adjusting to medications, gaining weight as a result, periods where he would go off his meds and relapse ... about 10 years later now and hes doing SO much better. He never gave up on playing music and is now a fairly successful jazz musician with a good fan following, a great girlfriend (not me) and seems happier than ever. Im sharing this with you so that you dont lose hope for him. If you treat him with love no matter what, I think he has the potential to live a happy, productive life."
Thank them and then quietly end your contact with his family. There's no way to continue a relationship with them.
"Yes send it !! My exes mom reached out recently after two years, they would both really appreciate it !!"

Get In Shape During Quarantine At Home (Two Dumbbells ONLY!)
why do you have a mask at home bro?
more importantly not even wearing it correctly.
"lol its photoshopped, I dont own one"
Anyone have anything written out for a good at home workout?
"Hard to argue with results, and he is kinda jacked, but the range of motion should really be increased for maximal results. If you're looking for more complete muscle development and to actually have strength all throughout a functional lift's range, all the way to the bottom and all the way to the top of a motion is going to ensure full contraction of the muscles, and encourage more complete muscle tears, and therefore fuller re-growth during muscular synthesis. At least the wisdom and science I've read/heard would support that."

"Something that helped me gain confidence.So, I know a lot of guys(including me) lacked confidence. I lacked confidence almost my entire life, I was not awkward but I still felt like I needed more confidence. One thing that helped me gain A LOT of confidence is this: One night I was extremely bored and thought I might download Tinder, so I did that and I upgraded to gold version. I changed my locations often to many different countries, I also downloaded some apps where you can talk to strangers online. I downloaded an app where you connect with snapchat and you can match with girls and talk to snapchat. How did this help me? Well I got some matches and started chatting with some girls from Poland, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, anyway the countries doesnt matter. I felt an immediate ego boost, to see that women from all around the world would want to talk to me. What matters is this, you are attractive, some girls will find you attractive, some wont. What you need to remember is that you are attractive! Anyways when I did this I noticed that I was talking to 10 or more girls that I probably wont ever meet in real life. I wasnt worried that I might say something wrong to drive them away from me, because they are so far away from me that I wont see them in real life. I just had fun and had interesting conversations. The thing is when I started talking to girls with whom I could actually meet up with I wasnt asking myself questions like Did I text her early, did I text her late, did I say something wrong? I just went with the flow and talked to them, I KNEW that I was attractive, I knew that women wanted to have conversations with me. What I got from my experience is that some women will like you and some wont and guess what, thats fine!! If you keep doing this, talking to girls from all around the world, I promise you will improve your confidence and conversation skills! So to summarize: download many online chatting and dating apps, meet women from all around the world, talk to them, you will see that when you talk to women from far away and when you talk to those women that you can actually meet up that there isnt a difference, you will gain confidence, you will improve your conversation skills, you will improve your text game! Anyways just wanted to share what helped me, if you want to know which apps I used just PM me and I will tell you! Remember guys, you are attractive!!"
what dating apps apart from tinder would you recommend?
What is the app you connected with snapchat?
Its called Hoop.
What app was connected to snap?

"Do you know of any apps for pc or sites where you can talk to women in one-on-one situations, that aren't necessarily dating-orientated?"
"Kind of weird, but I get it, practicing does well. But honestly if you messaging girls on dating Apps, and so concerned about what you say to matches, that's a problem."
For real though

"Do you seriously believe that you groom yourself to look good, dress well, have moderate professional success, fulfilling hobbies, and a close group of friends you hang out with regularly? Because if you dont. Then its a good place to start"
"TLDR: Make friends then move onto making girlfriends. Workout, dress well, smell well, groom the bush (even if you arent getting laid, the idea is to act like you are). Do you have friends that are girls? Talk to them on how to improve your style. If not, then you can ask a girlfriend of one of your friends. Be confident, talk crisply and clearly. Before you try to get a girlfriend, I'd suggest getting girl-friends. Since you're working, ask on of your girl coworkers out for coffee or something (specify its not a date and just as friends). You need to get confident with talking to girls and touching them. Learning to differentiate between a friendly touch and a flirty one is very important. Be genuinely nice, dont try and fake a personality. Often if the girl-friend actually likes you they set you up with one of their friends."

"Quitting porn and masturbation for the past four months and counting is literally the best and most empowering choice I have made in these journey. Higher energy level ,more powerful presence,deeper voice,greater calmness,higher self esteem ,and you know what ? Both men and women attraction for me has being crazy. Proud of me !"
">At this point I believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world. Think about it. There is a reason why Russia and China both have laws banning the production of it. They ban production of it because their society is based more so around judaeo-Christian values and they dont promote for personal freedom. They also censor any website or article that says something bad about the government >Blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis. (If your being hyperbolic my bad for taking it seriously) Fapping has no significant effect on testosterone,every study that depicts a change in testosterone all show the same result,testosterone goes up on day 7 of abstinence then goes back to normal on day 8. And having real sex had the same effect on testosterone"
"I am not sure about the conspiracy thing, but for having directly experimented with its effects, I can tell you that yes, porn has devastating effects on sexuality and arousal. But you know what? Good for the rest of us. I am in my 40s, I have seen quite a bit, and I can tell you than women nowadays dont get enough attention. Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid. It is a bit sad for women, as their needs do not get to be fulfilled, but it is also a fantastic time to live in if you dont watch porn and can maintain a normal sexuality!!"
"It's been a year for me. Now it's just ridiculous and I start thinking to myself, ""damn dude you're gonna jerk off to someone else having sex what the fuck are you doing."" Just quick way to simp hood in my opinion. I'll let the boys watch the porn while we go talk to the ladies in real life."
Youve uncucked yourself... and see the others as cucks. The veil is lifted!
"Apart from the more obvious dysfunctions, there's one big reason to stay away from porn forever and ever - and that's **neuroplasticity**. To put it bluntly, conditioning yourself to watch and masturbate to other men banging hot chicks is probably not the best for your future sexuality around real women."
I believe that to be the reason we see a rise in actual cuckoldry
"Does it really take 6 months to heal from death grip? I think that's what I have. I can still get it up for sex and stay hard even after busting. But I have noticed that sex doesn't feel as good anymore and I have to concentrate really hard to nut now, sometimes it doesn't even happen. I have no issue orgasming during masturbation though. This shit sucks and I hope it doesn't take that long to heal."
These guys are pretty much the voice of men on YouTube. I highly recommend giving them a look if youd like to hear some great points on controversial and race gender issues.
Thanks for pointing it out.
"""The voice of men"" ...those are quite the shoes to fill"
"I watched a couple videos and it seems alright... Like I don't disagree with any of the points they make but it's not what I would hope to gain from this subreddit either. I mean if I want to indulge in resent then it seems like a great YouTube channel, but I've always felt like being preoccupied with those emotions is more of a setback to my mental health than anything else."
"I do enjoy their videos but there are better ""voices for men"" specifically. They are just social commentators while people like Better Bachelor or Greg Adams are really putting out great stuff dealing with men's issues."
Woman is finally jailed after FIVE false rape allegations against her ex-boyfriends in eight years. Judge tells her she has harmed genuine rape victims with her lies.
Female privilege. Female privilege. Female privilege. This is what its like to be treated different because youre a man and not a woman.
Disgusting div. Have some paddy power! Silly woman!
So she's being jailed because she is hurting other women with her lies. Never mind the men being hounded out of career and home because of her false claims.
This
She should get 2 years for every accusation.
She should get 30 for every accusation. Each one of these dudes could have had their lives ruined and their social lives are basically gone just from the accusation. Would you want a possible rapist to be working at your company? Of course not.
"if she was driving her car and accidentally crashed it into a river/flood and started to drown and i was the only one around who could save her, i would actively just sit and watch. anyone else (a stranger) i would do whatever i could to help, but her, she can fucking drown for all i care and the world will be a better place."
Let this happen in family court too except its encouraged by the lawyers
And no one will belive you if you were actually raped now...so you fucked up
Yep.... THATS what happens...

14 Things You Should Never Apologize For
"Wow, this was actually a really helpful read. Particularly for work and going out with friends scenarios. Funny how I often find the need to apologize for some of these things, but when other people do it I instinctively find it a sign of weakness or feel unnecessarily sorry for them."
"Overall a decent list, but it's typed in a vacuum and not reality. A couple of thoughts as I read through this: You can apologize for your appearance if you know you look like a schlub. If you were invited to a dinner, and you thought it was only a 6/10 formal thing, and it turned out being an 8/10 formal thing, it's okay to apologize for being slightly underdressed. It could even be what starts a good conversation, although I wouldn't start with it. And you should apologize for expressing your emotions if the way you express them is harsh or hurtful to those you're expressing them too. I feel like the way this part was written can be interpreted into it being okay to go off on someone or something. No one ever says what they feel about something every time they feel it, the very second they feel it. Things always get bottled up to a degree. The listicle should mention that not being 100% forthright in your emotions is only natural, and that this is not carte blanche approval to erupt unapologetically. You could conceivably apologize if you're reaching out too often for help. It means you're aware of the other person's time. IDK. I just think that we shouldn't be afraid to apologize, instead of looking for every justification NOT to do so. Especially under the guise that it makes you look weak, when apologizing (maybe not *for* something, but *that it happened*) can make you more sincere, trustworthy, and considerate. I mean, the rest of the list is good, and even those things I called out, I get where the author is coming from. But people notice when nothing is ever your fault. And it's a major red flag."
"First of all thanks for the feedback, and I am not saying that apologizing is a bad thing. This list mentions all the points that don't require a sorry in general. If you feel sorry or regret doing anything wrong then it is very obvious that you must have done something wrong, in that case, you should apologize for it. I don't want to stretch it much, but I really liked your ideology."
"I didn't mean to sound overly critical, either. Knowing when and when not to say sorry is a nuanced thing in a lot of cases, but I do agree with a lot of this."
> that it happened Empty words.

Single male simps are just like women
Just look at how much females spend on makeup from their teen years on. It's a small fortune. I think about that and I'm glad I'm a man.
"I just meticulously measured and hung a 3-panel piece of art that I bought some years back. I had to make a run to the hardware store for a drywall anchor and decided to grab a growler of my favorite IPA on the way back. Hung them, measured, and measured again. I'll probably have a cold one and watch the latest episode of Billions before putting together a desk I've had in storage. Of course, this means rearranging the home office. I'll probably take a break and walk outside for a half-hour and then finish the job. I'll break it in with an hour or two of studying. After that, dinner. The store had ground 80/20 on clearance, so I'll dice up some shallots and make some pan burgers ([Julia Child-style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6ugR74z9M8)). Cutting the shallots and lettuce will give me an opportunity to practice my shitty-but-improving [knife skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMA2SqaDgG8). I found a recipe for copycat[ Big Mac sauce](http://secretcopycatrestaurantrecipes.com/mcdonalds-big-mac-special-sauce-copycat-recipes/) and made it last night.. It has been marinating in the fridge since. If everything goes right, I'll be watching some old K-1 fights or Moto GP races over burgers and beers before the sun goes down. I'll end the night with a couple of fingers of Canadian Club Apple with a splash of Vernor's. Maybe I'll play a few of the old records I found at the thrift store. Maybe I'll just sit in silence and enjoy my thoughts. To your average woman, this probably sounds incredibly boring. No drama, not much excitement... But to the single man, this is a joyous expression of freedom and self-love. No nagging, no bitching, no demands, no having to entertain some bottomless pit that can't find happiness in her own activities..."
Yup. Worked on my car for 8 hours yesterday with no interruptions only stopping for lunch and to sit in the backyard and have a drink or three. A boring day to some but heaven to me.
[Humor] Possum Reviews on unpleasable SJW fanbases...
"Archiving currently broken. Please [archive](https://archive.is) manually ---- I am Mnemosyne reborn. Bite my shiny, metal archive. ^^^/r/botsrights"
Dr Shaym at it again? His reviews never grow old!
I (34/M/Asian) hate the POC acronym so much.
"Pretty much everyone who isn't an SJW hates the term ""PoC"". Seriously, how is ""people of color"" any different from the dated, racist term ""colored people""? Either way, you're just saying ""everyone who isn't whitey"". You're grouping every single racial group (African, Asian, Latino, etc) and saying they're all the same because they're not of European descent. ""B-b-but, it's people-first language!"" What a bullshit defense. You haven't changed the words, or what they mean, just the order that they're said/written. It boggles my mind that this has become the ""progressive""/P.C./socially-acceptable term."
"Comments on that tweet brings something very important: The ""Guybrush paradox"" (I refuse to call it a theory). Whereas Guybrush can be flawed, a sex-changed version Galbrush couldn't without copious amount of outrage. I say, that's true in the west. But I usually consume media from the east. (Japan, Korean and Chinese comics/shows). They are not affected by that issue at all. Take for example One Punch Man. You got a woman that's crazy OP in the top S ranks, and also a sister that acts as gatekeeper of lower ranks. They have different character traits, flaws and ideals. Or Shield Hero. You got high ranking nobles (in a matriarchy) abusing their powers, and at the same time others who aren't. You got average people and slaves. Men or womens, doesn't matter. And of it's been teased that enemies from their invasion waves have at their heads heroes which we have seen 4: a male samurai, a male reaper, a female arch mage, and a female dagger/fan user. Very varied female representarton all around. Or Bofuri. Main cast is mainly female. One of the rival guild has a female guildmaster who has no confidence in herself. Maple's a dim-witted idiot who'se habit of EATING the obstacles on her way somehow made her the most powerful being imaginable... But she's still a naive idiot under the Demon Lord appearance. In Soul Land (Korean manwha/show), there's a varied amount of males and females all different, with flaws and all, and the discrimination is based entirely on if they're humans or magical beasts, or class warfare. Womens are pretty powerful in that story. But if you would try those shows here, they would all be criticised for their depictions of womens. Because outrage scammers needs to scam so that their blackmail gives them another paycheck on their patreon."
"See, the problem is you're comparing Western media to Eastern. In Western media, a character isn't just a character. No, they *represent* an entire class of people! At least, that's how it is to the loudest voices (i.e. ""journalists"" and Twitter-addicted losers). You can't have a Galbrush in Western media, because if she's abused or is a failure, it somehow represents *all women* or how the author *views* all women, and is thus sexist. In Eastern media, a character IS just a character, and not a vehicle for representation. At least, the media/fans don't treat it as such (unless it's reviewed by Western media idiots, like ANN). So, you *can* have a Galbrush in Eastern media, because she is allowed to be flawed or is allowed to fail or be abused. You rarely see any ""controversy"" about anime/manga/LNs until they come over here... For example, I believe ANN had interviewed the director or producer of the Goblin Slayer anime (I think?) and asked them about how they handled the controversy over in Japan, and their response was basically ""what controversy?"" That is to say, it's not like they *don't* get whiners from the East. Like with the recent ""controversy"" over a My Hero Academia villain... it was *Chinese* fans getting angry, claiming the character's name was a WW2 reference... So Horikoshi changes the character's name... and then they're *angry about the new name*, too."

"Do you think a large number of millennial and gen z men will end up without a life partner and chance to reproduce?To clarify, [millennials are defined as being born between 1981 and 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials). Gen z are those born from 1997 onwards. It seems like a lot of men in the millennial and gen z age range are really struggling with the sexual marketplace and finding a partner. Judging from my own observations and the discussion I read on the internet (not just on reddit, but across different social media platforms and forums). Women just consider them invisible. Large portions of them aren't having any sex at all, a lot less than previous generations, which means they won't get the chance to have kids unless that changes. In contrast, it seems like the vast majority of gen x men and boomer men found life partners relatively easily. It seems extremely rare to find a 40+ year old man who hasn't been married, had kids nor had at least one long term partner (unless they are a Chad, but at least they are getting regular sex). Men are told a lot on here that most men end up finding a partner and having kids, but do you think this will be true of millennial men and gen z men? What do you reckon?"

"It's the economy and standard of the living, and information technology. So yeah alot of guy's are going to miss out unless they donate sperm to a sperm bank or co-parenting with a female who what's kids like a single career woman that didn't get a husband at the earliest time or lesbian's"
"Maybe? Its difficult to say, but I think that's sort of the plan. The US has been trying for the last century to figure out ways to control the growth of the population without outright killing people or forcefully sterilizing them, and unfortunately for some, this did happen. I learned that some states in the US had eugenics programs where people were sterilized against their will back in the 40's and 50's. Since then, the government has been using more covert methods to manipulate fertility and hormone levels. Misinformation through the use of media is also one of those methods. Never has there been a population more confused about sex and sexual relationships than we are today. There are some men in their 40's and 50's who are still virgins, and it seems that the number of virgins overall has been increasing."
"I hope so for their sake, there are much more opportunities for men when they remain single."

"Here refers to /r/feminism in the linked post. Not surprised, as she is quite opposed to it."
"The modern answer is it depends. As there is lots of segments of feminism that believe in advocacy for women it depends. A job that involves punching? Well women can do it, it would be sexist to treat them differently. Police report of violence. Of course the larger man was more cabable of inflicting harm and so even less hits thrown is worth a greater punishment. The double standards in various parts of advocacy are so transparent that it should be a standard question about whether they are just blatantly advocating for women at mens expense at this point."

Give us an example that worked tho.
"I figured somebody would be smart enough to ask this question, but since I value the lesson more than the length I decided against putting it in the main post, but lucky for you I have one saved for people like yourself. &#x200B; About a month after I blew it with the Filipina chick, I ended up meeting a brunette that was a solid HB9. It was at an upscale cafe I frequent every now and then. Since I emphasize common sense, I didn't walk up to her and say ""holy shit I want you to ride my dick until it looks like a deflated pepperoncini"" but I played it cool conversationally until it was time to bag the number, without any hesitation or planning I said... &#x200B; **""Look, you need a man like me in your life.""** I gave her my phone. **""Put your number in my phone and I'll invite you over.""** &#x200B; She's not stupid. It was very clear I was talking about inviting her over to dick her down. She looked extraordinarily surprised at my forwardness and complied. Two weeks went by (I was extraordinarily busy) and I called her and **told** her I wanted to see her tonight. I gave her my address, we hooked up, but I decided against plating her because she was psycho and I could tell she had some daddy issues."
So there's this thing called #metoo... Easy to get fucked by it.
"Youre a nobody. Youre not getting #metood, get a grip. Just dont be a sperg and say youre gonna rape her or something retarded."

"1. Whatever vibration you put out, you will attract A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners. Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play One of those factors, sadly, are looks. And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok. it can be used as a form of endearment. You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like. Also you might think youre a nice guy...but if youre posting here and believing some of these Ill written advices...youre probably not as nice of a guy as you think."

"What kind of music do you listen to?I really enjoy Folk, Jazz, Bedroom Pop, Indie, R&B/Soul, Bluesy stuff. Ive always wondered if there is a certain kind of music that really suits this lifestyle, or makes you feel especially feminine and beautiful."
"I enjoy a mix of pop, alternative, and even some punk rock too."
I love alternative and punk rock! Do you have any recommendations?
My SO is really into punk rock and he introduced me to a 90s East Bay band called 'Jawbreaker' which I really like! I also recommend listening to 'Gob' as well.
"I'm redpill, but I listen to rock, punk, alt, oldschool hip-hop and rap"
"I'll listen to almost anything if it's good. I do love some romantic oldies (The Ronettes, The Crystals, Four Tops, Darlene Love), which do make me feel feminine and generate loving thoughts about my Captain. But I listen to a lot of new wave, gothic rock, alternative rock, noise rock, lo-fi, indie rock, experimental music, classical music, even some industrial. I even enjoy Death Grips (which my Captain hates)."
"I listen to almost every genre of music, but in terms of femininity? Usually neoclassical or folk music, or occasionally soft pop. These three songs immediately come to mind: https://youtu.be/2y4jSkOVgbI https://youtu.be/dS5GfL9F7L4 https://youtu.be/3fUvYUpICW4"
"I listen to everything, but my favorite is power metal. It really depends on my mood tho, but Im always ready to listen to music that makes me feel like Im riding a dragon."
"If its good, I listen to it! My boyfriend is a hip hop head, he loves the culture and is always exploring new artists since the genre is constantly changing so I enjoy having playlists set to new music on my Spotify. I still have a radio station in my car set to alternative rock/punk/rock that plays a lot of the hits from the earlier 2000s that Ill forever listen to, like Pearl Jam and audioslave, beastie boys, etc"
"I like hymns when Im feeling worshipful. I am stuck on 90s music LOL. Acoustic, mellow guitar is also where I am most of the time though."
Have you LJBF'd a girl? How she reacted? Do they even give a fuck about it like we do?Edit: what do yall think it's worse for them: getting LJBF'd or getting ghosted?
"Really bad, her friend kinda harass me until i block them on any social media, and an other one drunk text me every month saying to me that i was ugly ahaha. But i keep her unblocked to dread my actual GF"
"Of course they get it, they use it constantly and most know exactly what it means. It's a sudden surprise to them that they don't have complete power over you with their sexuality. LJBF'd with a meme (the ""I lied, there's no sex"" memes are funny). She laughed on April 11th, then on April 16th she colored her hair pink, then she didn't invite me to her birthday on the 18th (which she'd told me about a million times; I LJBF'd because she was messaging me way too much)."
Lol they don't like it at all.
"I have, they dont take rejection well."
"Meh they take it badly for an hour or so then slap a revealing picture on insta for 300cc' of V A L I D A T I O N then fire up tinder and they're on to the next one. &#x200B; However, that hour or so of shock is worth it."
pretty much this... it is satisfying to flip the script on em though haha
Complete insanity...like showing up to my job unannounced and causing a scene type shit.
"Uuuh question, what does your attraction for handsome men have to do with cuckold psychology? I mean I can see why you keep getting banned and thrown out of places if you keep asking these questions in subs completely unrelated to your question. Also try r/femaledatingstrategy that's basically a femcel sub and I'm sure that they would welcome your question over there."
I tried cuckold psychology first months ago to talk about these things. Because i had read online that cucks allowed their gfs/wives to sleep with other men to gain sexual satisfaction. But none of that is true. Cuckolds are just as insecure as regular men if not way way more and they hate beauty.
I think you might have a problem with how males are depicted in pornography.
I dont look at porn. I mean i come across it but i dont use it to cum.
"That's worse, that means the only real interactions you have that would influence you would only come from film and television or romance novels if you read them. I mean if you want to hang out waiting for your Chris Hemsworth to come swoop you off your feet then that's up to you. Hell I wouldn't kick him out of bed and I'm not even gay. And if you can get yourself one then I say go for it. I'm sure there's some strapping lad out there with your name on. Wait I've completely forgotten what your actual point was. You got banned for saying you only want to shag handsome men? That it? Doesn't seem fair, I just got banned from r/domesticabuse for telling a woman whose partner would beat her harder if she cried out or fought back to get the hell out of there. Apparently its horrible and insensitive to tell them to leave their abuser. Welcome to reddit where you get banned for shouting in the echo chamber."
Idk who that is. Yea i got warned on forum for women who were diddled as children for telling a woman the same thing. The mod told me that telling that to a abuse victim can send them into a crisis. But i got banned from suicidewatch for apperently hating abortions (i love them btw) and they dont have any protocal regarding that? Pathetic. If i kill myself im including that in the note.
"Are you suicidal because you love beauty or is there something else? , it's ok to like beautiful things but dont get stuck in this mindset"
Its beauty.
"So you want to kill yourself because you love beauty ? If so, we should all die then"
Boyfriend vs Husband benefits?Ladies. I am at odds. I realised that I have been treating my boyfriend like my husband - what should I do about this? We've been together for 2 years (the first year was on and off and this year has been stable). Yesterday night we were talking on the phone and I joked saying I like the nick name Bubby because its hubby and baby mixed into one. We have been discussing marriage alot since being in Quarantine so I guess I felt comfortable making that joke. Then he said laughing that it was too soon and I shouldn't call him that. That shut me down - it made me realise I have been giving myself to someone as if he were my husband when he doesn't see himself that way or me like his wife. He is a good guy. He is loving and I would like to marry him some day. He said that however and I pretty much hung up and now I have this innate unease when I think about him. I know it is not his fault but I think I am more annoyed with myself for getting carried away - I am 20 and he is my first boyfriend so I can see why I fell into this pit of fantasy. When he said that it burst my bubble... I've lost my sexual attraction to him - me and him aren't really tied in any way so why should I give myself? We have treated sex casually in the relationship but I have been moving towards Chastity for a while now so because we are distanced due to this quarantine I have been turning him down for sexting and so on. I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before? I cant help but see him as a user - even though that's not what is going on... I dont want to see him or have him touch me rn? I know I am being over dramatic. So... What are husband benefits? What are boyfriend benefits? Should I learn to compartmentalise the two? What are your experiences? How do I make it clear that wifey is something to be earned and that I am no longer going to be the way I was before? Thank you so much sisters
"You are 20 and your SO is 24, which means he was about 22 when you met and started dating. It is rare that men are dating for marriage at that age. It is unlikely that he is dating you with marriage in mind. I was a couple of years older than you when I met my husband, who was in his late 20s at the time. We were both dating for marriage and moved in together after only 6 months and were engaged in less than a year and married less than a year after that. Very, very little has changed from the time we started living together and now as far as how we act. There is very little distinction between girlfriend and wife. For most women, the only distinction is allowing the government into your relationship through legal marriage. For some women, it may also mean engaging in physical activity outside of hand holding and side hugs. Here, I think the real issue is that your SO is not old enough to truly be prepared for marriage. At your age, relationships tend to take much longer before marriage. Among my husbands friends, those who met their partners in their early 20s took nearly a decade to propose. In contrast, those who met in their partners in their late 20s and early 30s were ready to commit to marriage in 6-12 months."
Theres a lot going on in your post. You say you were off and on the first year maybe thats why he feels like its too soon? Guys like to test relationship out not in a bad way but just to see if it will last. For example my boyfriend just recently started to tell his family about me even though weve been dating for 2 years and I completely understand that it takes time to vet a potential spouse. Also are you withholding sex because you feel like it will give you more power or an upper hand the the relationship? If so then thats the wrong move sex isnt something you give your partner is something you do WITH your partner and if you plan on not having sex when you previous were then it should be a discussion with him.
"> I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before? You've had a fundamental shift in your thinking, which is perfectly healthy at 20. That being said, he is under no obligation to go along with it and probably won't. You might need to start considering if this is actually the right relationship for you. Aside from that, husband benefits is an interesting topic. We usually only talk about wife benefits. I would say the following are singular to a husband: For better or for worse: This pandemic has been really rough on me, on the heels of some other life altering stress. I've not handled it well. Vetting is over, though. We're married and my husband takes that seriously and has been my rock through my stress and tears and paranoia. I have been a *chore* of a wife at times, this year. I would never expect a boyfriend to put up with that. For richer or for poorer: As your husband, his money is likely yours. Before marriage, anything he buys for you is a gift. Don't forget it and *never* ask for financial help. I actually have a rather long anecdote about my husband thinking I was about to ask for money when we were dating, when it was the furthest thing from my mind. It would have seriously dampened the relationship and he would have refused. In sickness and in health: It's perfectly acceptable for him to bring you soup when you're sick or hang out with you and watch movie, but he isn't obligated to care for your physical well-being like he would were you married. When I nearly cut off my thumb last year, my husband took off work, rescheduled his call shift, picked me up as my emergency contact, drove me across the city to get stitched up under worker's comp, and stopped to get Chinese food on the way home for me. That is pretty above and beyond and while it would be nice of a boyfriend to do it, I'm not sure it's fair to expect it. The same goes for running out to get medicine or cleaning out the trashcan after you've thrown up. The mundane: Sharing household chores and responsibilities and daily routines really muddies the water and it's why I caution cohabitation. My husband is in this for life, so cleaning my hair out if the drain is part of that, as are all the other gross parts of living with humans and the pets we share. I would never expect a boyfriend to take responsibility for trimming the dogs' nails, putting up the Christmas lights, chopping up the Christmas tree for firewood, or getting our oil changed. Those are husband tasks, as are the many little chores we've decided to split between ourselves."
Just curious but why date someone who is not marriage material? Isn't that the point of dating?
"I know youre going to get some comments here putting you down and saying you cannot giveth and then taketh away. But I cant help but to be sympathetic because I know the feeling of being excited about someone and being sexually giving at first, and then losing attraction when it starts to become clear that he wont be committing. Obviously one comment on the phone might not mean much, but it seems like your gut may be telling you there is something to think about here. Have there been other signs that you guys are not on the same page?"
"Your job as a girlfriend is to show you WILL be an awesome wife, not make yourself into one right away. Only husband's get wives - boyfriends don't. You're bending over backwards letting him enjoy the perks of having a ""marriage like"" relationship without giving you any of those perks himself. I would absolutely cut off the sex. And if he's not husband material, time to leave the relationship. Why waste time on someone you know doesn't have any staying power??"
You are not being being over-dramatic. He was never in it for marriage anyway. It's time to dump his useless behind.
I think if you want marriage at your age you probbalt have to go for a guy who is at least 25 but probbaly more like 28+.

"How to proceed with a virgin? (34F)So I (28M) met this woman off a dating app. She is quite hot and I was surprised to learn that she was still virgin (religious/cultural reasons), since she went down for oral on the third date at her place. She basically said that her virginity is for the guy she will marry and/or consider marriage material and although I like her a lot, I am not sure if I want to sacrifice my freedom for a bit of sex. But she is very to me and we match on a lot of things. I guess I am unsure about what to do."
"She's down for oral. Just stick with that and get to know her. If you're not looking for a relationship, let her know and don't waste her time. She's upfront and let you know she won't fuck you. Pick a lane buddy. Date her or don't. Don't be the guy that pressures someone for sex"
"If she's kept her virginity this long, she's definitely in it for the long haul. Sorry bud, either get hitched or hit the rookie road"
"Marry her! JK. Just keep dating and respecting her wishes. You may feel like she's the one, and if not you can move on."
"Keep her as a plate and keep having sex with other girls and if you guys are still going strong in a while and being with her starts being more interesting to you than new girls, then by all means become exclusive and work towards marriage, at this point I wouldn't lock her in because you don't know if you actually like her or just the sex."
"In my experience, women who are still virgins love hard. Good or bad depending on your preference, it was good for me. One of the best relationships I've ever had."
"Move on the sex is never worth the wait. And if shes quite hot shell get plenty of attention from guys and although she says shes still a virgin I honestly would doubt that, unless there something wrong with her personality. You can verify that by asking about the best memory of her child hood. If she doesnt tell you a story involving a male father figure, I suggest you walk away. Shell never appreciate what you as a man brings to the table and also has trouble with men in general."
The other guys here have given solid advice. The only thing Ill add is shes not a virgin. Shes just decided to not disclose that with you for whatever reason.
I bet she told that to every guy she fucked. Sorry but 34 yo virgin looking for love on tinder sounds like a fucked up deal.
He never mentioned Tinder. Hmm. What if she's a virgin what makes ya think she aint? Why is it fucked up?
"There is a ""blind leading the blind"" belief in this sub that's hiding in plain sightThat belief is the ""Don't be friends with the girl you're attracted to otherwise you'll be stuck in the friendzone"" belief. The reason I know that the people who push this idea are ""blind"" or really, inexperienced or just don't know what they're talking about, is because for most of these people, if they have a girlfriend and she's friends with this cool guy and she always hangs out with him, they recognize the possibility that she could cheat on them with him. But why would you think that she could cheat if befriending a girl supposedly keeps a guy stuck in the friendzone? Or do the ""rules"" somehow not apply to that guy but they do to you? Friendship doesn't put you in the friendzone. The friendzone comes as a consolation prize from a girl who rejects your sexual advances and it is also sometimes a way for the occasional girl who has issues to manipulate and take advantage of a guy. Its not your friendliness that puts you in the friendzone. Its the lack of a girl's attraction for you that does. You can be that cool guy that all the girls want. Don't listen to blind people who project their own insecurities onto you. ... **If this has been helpful to you and you want more advice like this...** A lot of you have sent me direct messages asking for my advice because you read a comment or post I made on this sub, just like this one, and found it to be very helpful/insightful/meaningful and I'm happy to say I've been able to help you guys so much more because of that. Here's the problem: More and more messages are coming in and I really want to help but its getting hard to keep up. So I've put together a Facebook group for you guys that want to improve your dating lives and want to actually understand the psychology behind our interactions with not only women but with ourselves and people in general. If you want to be part of a group that believes in finesse over brute force, technique over strength, smart work over hard work, Seduction over pursuit then [click on this link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/531515740873357/) and request to join. If you are serious about getting better with women then I'll be happy to welcome you in."
It's crazy that someone would downvote this. This is a hell of a good point.
"Think of the friendzone as a bonus life in a video game, you got one more chance to ask her out, she says no. gg's move on. Unless you actually like her as a person in which case congrats you just earned a new friend."
">Think of the friendzone as a bonus life in a video game, you got one more chance to ask her out, she says no. gg's move on. Exactly my point. She put you there because she wasn't interested, not because you were too friendly. And yes, you can try again."
"> Its not your friendliness that puts you in the friendzone. Its the lack of a girl's attraction for you that does. It is, however, your friendliness that led to the lack of her attraction to you. > You can be that cool guy that all the girls want. Observe that guy closely and get a feel for how friendly he is. He isnt very friendly at all, and thus never loses his attractiveness to women and ends up in the FZ as a result. Thats partially *why* hes the cool guy that all the girls want. You will note that hes **never** the warm and friendly guy that all the girls want."
You right that can put u in the wrong place but i have to say this not every girl the same some u have to move directly to the relationship zone others it would be better to be in the FZ first and that cool guy is because he already build a reputation of being that cool with girls. Think about him im sure he has alot of friends that are girls and boys he usually never alone its not because he is cool that he is never alone or never with one girl its actually the opposite he is cool because he is never alone and usually not with one girl with him. Its just a himan nature when u see many people trying to get something or being around someone its just get us to think that thing or person must be great or cool for those many people to want him.
Thats a great point actually im glade someone did say that. But about that statement i think it sould hold true for some of the guys here that only want one night thing or just sex. If thats the case the shouldnt bother being friends with them and I don't think this is the subreditt for that thing that is pick up not seduction.
"Friendship doesn't put you in the friendzone? Uhmm... what? That's exactly what friendzone means. You are **just** friends. However, you are right. If you get friendzoned by a girl and accept to remain friends with her that doesn't mean it's permanent. But if it's intimacy you are looking and you are in a hurry then you'd better go looking for other girls."
Being in the friendzone means you're stuck as friends. Being friends means you've just chosen to be friends but can still change that.
"You are correct that its about a lack of attraction that creates friendzones. But the rest is nonsense. Why would you promote being friends with a girl(s) you want to fuck? If youre trying to get at her, then youre not buddies. If you make it known and she isnt into it (her choice) then what are you gonna do, just hang out w her all the while she knows you wanna fuck her? No. Thats some cake-ass shit. Wtf? And if you do end up fucking guess what? Youre no longer friends. However if the vibe is good and the time is right you can develop into a friendship while youre fucking but thats another story. Stop playing yourself and stop lying. Youre not interested in being her friend. You want to fuck her. Your advice is terrible and promotes around the way, indirect approaches to women and sexuality."
Fuck her. If she can't be with you and support you at your lowest point then she damn well doesn't deserve you at your highest point.
Sorry about your dad.
"Sorry for you dad my bro. Her loss, she also died for you"
"Im sorry. Not gonna sugar coat it and say its easy. But for real just take it easy and grieve. You can get back to self improvement and stoicism later when youre ready. Just survive. The emotions will one day not be as strong as they are, until one day they are gone completely, one minute, hour and day at a time."
May your dad rests in peace

"> We must gain 50% STEM (forget about the rest of uni though)and 50% board rooms. The other stuff, we don't want Do you have anything suggesting this is a position held by NKF?"
"I mean if all you're aiming for is gender equality, then sure. Sadly the reality for many countries like Israel and South Korea is that conscription is still very much seen as necessary (and in Israel at least it already includes women) so you're sorta throwing the baby out with the bathwater on that one."
"Isreal has less years for women. Also commonly women are heavily favoured in the military, treated nicer and artificially promoted. They are not sent to actual war, but in safe zones... basically they get the glory of war without really doing much. Norway, is gender neutral in law but not in practice... same as above preferential treatment, artificial promotion and actually their numbers are still low despite the law"

"Reposting what I said in another sub: I understand and respect the arguments put forward here by the author, but I disagree. My major contention is with the idea that we should avoid working on one area of inequality because it is currently in tension with another area - expressed here as the concept that the disparate impact of childbirth and rearing on women should affect our decisions on conscription. This kind of ""tit-for-tat"" inequality, where the argument is that equality of a sort can be reached by a balance of inequalities, is in my opinion a barrier to progress. Refusing to accept a balance of inequalities does, however, mean we must be careful in our prioritisation of our efforts."
Amber heard has not been fired from aquaman 2
Let this be a lesson to women everywhere: if you think you can abuse men and lie about it to make yourself the victim for personal gain you are totally correct. Go for it. Gurl power! Literally nothing will happen to you and we'll cheer when you do it again and again and again. This is exactly what MeToo and timesup is about.
"Boycott the film. If anything talks to a studio like this, it's money."
"Oh, I was thinking more Molotov cocktail-y"
nah nah nah that won't do anything
"Yeah, the dozens of people who actually care about male victims of domestic violence will have our voices heard! Sorry for the pessimism."
"Actually, I think a few million people won't see the film because of what's happened to Depp, the evidence coming out in his favour and Warner Bros continued stance on Amber Heard being the victim and refusing to admit that they were wrong."
It's funny when those rich corporations just double down when it's revealed they've been supporting a scumbag all along.
They don't want to say they were wrong. It's the same when they make woke films. They won't blame that it's because of the wokeness that the films flop. They blame the men for not watching the films and so double down on the wokeness of the films.
"She is obviously a victim of the patriarchy. And besides, Mr Depp must have done something to make her upset. So her reaction was totally reasonable. And here's an /s if someone takes this the wrong way."
Mfw 6'3 average looking guys call themselves incels
fakecel fags that like to fucking larp that they are incel are the most pathetic pieces of trash I've come across
6'2 is the average zoomer height in white western countries
You would have to literally never leave your home to believe this is true.
Blackpilled spaces in general tend to attract average to above average narcs who aren't willing to accept they're not Chad
"""Im 6'3 and white, but im as much as an incel as you are!!!"""
Being white is fine its just the height part. Its really fucking hard to be one as a white person over 61. You literally will have at least 2 orbiters at any given time on you 511 or under is green zone for whites with bad faces
"Yeah being white is fine, but there is a certain type of so called incels who come here who are white and taller than 6'0."
"soon trucels wont be welcome here anymore, only failed normies and fakecels"
I literally just got Pmed by a chadlite asking me rate him fucking lol. The absolute state of this sub
"Opinions on breast reduction?Im interested to know what you think about a woman considering a breast reduction. Has anyone here had one? What was the opinion of your boyfriend/husband? Im a 25yo single woman with naturally large breasts (32I). Im thinking about the possibility of a reduction in the future. Its not about appearance, rather its the back pain, shoulder grooves, and also the fact that bras in my size are expensive. Thoughts and opinions are much appreciated!"
Asked my husband. He would be totally on board because it would improve my quality of life. The only real concern would be whether I would be able to breastfeed.
"Half the women in my family have had them. It's a quality of life thing. I'm not sure how it would *affect breastfeeding, so best to research that if it's something important to you. I don't think any reasonable man would consider it 'cosmetic surgery', if you're worried about that."
If it causes you pain and discomfort I would absolutely go for it. My only consideration would be if you are planning to have children in the near future as it may have an impact on breastfeeding. Also if youre planning on having children soon you may just want to wait until after youre done breastfeeding and your boobs have changed which they inevitably will.
I think you have to do what is best for you and your health. Fuck everyone else. Only issue is money and recovery
"I asked my husband and he would be absolutely fine with it. However, we both find breastfeeding important. I have fed the oldest for almost 2 years now and the youngest for 8 months, and am planning to continue for at least another year. So wed both want for me to wait until I have birthed and fed all the children we might have. A question I was wondering about, and I hope this doesnt come across as rude: does any of it have to do with weight? I had a friend with very large breasts who was considering a reduction, but was also on the heavy side. She lost 3 cup sizes when she lost about 10kg, and looks so much better in proportion now. Because she also did a lot of strength training during her weight loss journey, she no longer has any back or shoulder pain. If this doesnt apply to you, then I would think a reduction would be the only solution."
"I thought that too, but 32 is quite a small band size, isn't it?"
"Oh you are right! I somehow missed that, I am so sorry. 32 is like a size 4 or 6 right? Im European, so sizes here are different."
"Do barbell raws, back and abs training, pain will be gone and youll be able to keep your natural assets."
"If you'd like to rephrase less crudely, I'm sure your point is sound, but we won't tolerate that sort of language. [EDIT] thank you."
My irl brocel is a software engineer and this is the car he is going to buy after 6 years of hard nonstop grinding. It may sound like major cope but this thing is fucking menacing in person and mogs normies cars to oblivion. If you love cars you know how insane the 911 turbo AWD is
"He is putting $30,000 down and financing the rest. Of course he will get approved for the loan due to his god tier 800+ credit score. Crazy happy because I love cars and he told me he will let me take it out sometimes, I know its not mine and I have no right to flex but FUAAAAA I cant wait to rip this thing on the roads and turn heads"
Have fun dude. Its not every day that you get to drive a fucking Porsche 911. I hope you have a lot of fun
"A regular Porsche 911 isn't a huge deal, but that's no ordinary 911, it's a 991.2 Turbo, and it's insanely quick. It can keep up with supercars that have over 100 hp more and still seat 4 people in a pinch. The Turbo S does 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, which is Veyron territory."
I just want a work model Toyota tacoma
Those are nice man. I love everything from 60s American muscle to 2020 hypercars lol Im just hype af to get the chance to rip around a boosted Porsche and of course happy for my friend for letting his hard work pay off
A nice reliable truck that'll get the job done Toyotas are amazing
Im a simple man. Reliability is what matters most. If you cant count on it being there for you when you need it theres no point in having one to begin with
"Those 911s make some fuckin horse dude. Yes those mf are insane. Personally if I had the money for a 911 Id rather go with something else but if thats what he likes he needs to go for it. He will mog and outrun everyone in sight. Personally I want to get a Chevy 70 and put a 383 stroker, new exhaust and new speakers renew the interior in all itd cost like 25-30 grand its not Porsche 911 money but itll make 550 horse and itll outrun a lot of people especially if I strap a turbo on that bad boy. When it comes to modern cars, I personally wouldnt want one because I dont like all the computer stuff with them they rely too much on technology and shit if that computer fails the cars fucked. HOWEVER I like how they look and theyre fast motherfuckers if you know how to use the computers for them and you know how to use the tech in them. If I had 911 money and I was getting a modern car Id get a Audi R8 you can get the pre-2010 models for 60 grand 90-100 grand customized theyre nice to customize the design (look up uzi verts R8) and they make some horsepower alright"
"As a short guy, how should i respond to shit tests?Im 56, train jiu jitsu, i workout 6 times a week. Im around 140-150 lbs. This isnt one of those loser short guy stories. I have lots of friends, but this one dude who comes around every so often always talks some major shit. He always says stuff about how he wishes I would try and beat my ass so he could show me how much of a little boy he is, talks about how he loves beating up short guys, how they are all pathetic little boys. This dude gets off on apparently hurting short guys. Hes 510 and probably 130 lbs. hes not a stud, hes a loser financially, he doesnt have anything going for him. I dont think its ever worth fighting, especially as I am a rising leader in my local business community I will not risk any of that for some loser. So i kind of just need advice. How should I handle some dude so hostile."
"5'2, 150 guy here, I trained wrestling and judo basically my whole life. Challenge him. If you really know bjj, you should know that he doesn't stand a chance. Don't be a bitch and let him talk to you like that."
"Ya, ive done that once. I challenged him to a grappling match i took his back and had him in a RNC and let it go. He always brings it up to me and challenges me to a kickboxing fight. He is a trained kickboxer so id for sure lose that. Plus im not trying to fight, again i have so much to lose financially and reputation and he isnt worth it."
"Here is what i would do genuinely. Since you have established that you can easily take him down and take his back, ask for a fight. Take him down again and take his back but start smacking the shit of him once you have him. He won't bother you again, I guarantee it."
"Nah, dude this guys just not worth it. Hes been arrested numerous times for domestic violence, expelled from school for violence. Hes just a fucking psycho. Im not trying to prove anything physical to a psycho."
"If you know you could take this guy so easily why are you sweating him so much? The fact you work out and could kick his ass doesn't mean anything since the fact that he's jabbing at you is getting you emotional. That's why he keeps doing it. Learn to be cold. You know you can take him and that he's just huffing hot air, so don't sweat him."
I guess im sweating him cause i just dont have anyone around me who is an asshole like that. Hes an asshole to other people too. How do you mean be cold?
"Let him be an asshole. Cold as in non emotional. If he keeps doing it and you become completely non reactive or just ignore when he comes at you, it'll stop because it's not longer fun for him."
">i wonder what other people think of me when i ignore him There it is. I knew that was prolly the real reason of the post. Dude, what other people think isn't your problem. Your job is to be the best man you can be regardless of how others think. Most ppl you know prolly don't really give 2 shits about you or him that much to have an opinion about it, anyways"
Men don't approach anymore ...I hear this quite often by women complaining they don't get approached and it begs the question: are men that bad today? The reason why a man will not approach women is because he had negative past experiences. He has tried several times and failed which makes him even less reluctant to make the next move. I firmly believe this explains why the majority of men don't approach anymore.

"Extreme Ascension FantasiesHiya, I know this is a cope, but I often daydream of having cosmetic surgery to the point of looking like a normal and acceptable human -- that is, nice, and certainty completely unrecognisable from the neck up. I fantasise about then revisiting old spaces and groups, and being accepted and welcomed by people who rejected and ignored me in the past. I think about how wonderful it would be to have them invite me out; to be accepted into their friendship circles and belong. I fantasise about interviewing for respectable posts for which I am well-qualified, and being seriously considered for those posts instead of heaped on the mental reject pile within the first 8 seconds. I fantasise about being able to play attractive and age/gender-appropriate characters onstage. Does anyone else have such daydreams? Is this ""maladaptive"", and is there anything wrong with that?"
"Yes especially the revisiting old groups part. I still want my high school and even midschool classmates to accept me and maybe even invite me to hang out, i daydream about it a lot"
"i have this too I actually find it pretty comforting and it helped me a lot in highschool to focus on work because I would weave it into the fantasy, which is better than feeling depressed/anxious.. but then of course reality hits hard when you have to come out of the daydreams lol"
I also realized that if i spend more time near people i start to have less fantasies because i will be too aware of reality
Have you ever gone in and recieved quotes for the work you would need to get done? Just to have a number? Edit: all I do is daydream when I'm not engaging with the real world. It is my happy place.
"I have not, but I know at least 50000 would probably be required altogether. :( 2.5 years of income for me without the side entertainment business I can't do during lockdown."
"> Does anyone else have such daydreams? Yes, I think a lot of us do this as well, even normies. &nbsp; > Is this ""maladaptive"", and is there anything wrong with that? It depends. Like I said, daydreaming is something even normies/NT's will do, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad. &nbsp; It becomes ""maladaptive"" when it's used as your preferred coping mechanism for loneliness or boredom (just two examples). Daydreaming might feel nice at the moment you engage in it, but especially the maladaptive kind will take up significant chunks of free time that you could be using to solve the underlying problems that are causing you to daydream in the first place. &nbsp; Indicators of daydreaming being maladaptive are for example: - making facial expressions/talking during daydreaming sessions - feeling distressed when something is preventing you from daydreaming - preferring daydreaming over real life activities/socializing &nbsp; These are just a few things I remember. I don't have any advice on how to stop it, though. I also love fantasizing about ascending. It feels so good."
"When my depression was the lowest I basically lived in a daydream for 2 years. A had about 8 different ones and would daydream constantly. In class, at home, with my mom/family. They were all about being pretty and smart and how different my life would be."
"Every day. This is a weird story, but I remember watching Survivor when I was a kid and one of winners, Ethan from Season 3 (I'm old lmao), was SUPER hot and I had a huge crush on him. Anyway, they showed a picture from his as a kid around my age and he was nerdy and unattractive and I had hope that when I aged I would be beautiful like Ethan. Anyway, that didn't work out. I also would like to get cosmetic surgery (mostly a nose job, but I would also like a breast reduction with implants (to have a nice shape, but I want small boobs)). But I'm afraid I'll start and never be able to stop, so I just refuse to do it. I don't want to look like one of those women with too much. But I do really want to get botox in my upper lip for a less gummy smile."
"I have a beautiful version of me in my head who is powerful and a genius and I daydream (maladaptively??) abt being able to navigate society w/ confidence. I'm no longer impoverished and financially secure w/a job wherein I excel (u know, bc I'm a genius). I retain my exact personality, but money + opportunities are drawn to me bc of my appearance/the masks I wear. I don't go around old groups for acceptance, but they hear of me bc I'm notable and my greatness makes them feel small. I'm also living my dream (tiny home, plush, tasteful decor, cats). total cope!! I've been daydreaming since I was around...10?? LOL it's a lot xD"

"Even if I am the most happiest person in the entire universe, it still wouldn't stop me from thinking that this universe is worth destroying because of all the gruesome, excruciating suffering it has cause to many sentient beings."
"If you are referring to suffering in a political, military, scientific way, I agree. The fact that normal people are the elites personal test tube and play ground is nauseating. But I can't hate the individuals that don't know that they live in this playground and that everything they do has been planned and controlled."
"Oh I am not really talking specifically about the situation of our current generation. I just think that existence of sentient consciousness is a mistake for the fact that suffering is forcibly imposed to them, hence the entire chaos we are trapped in after millions of years of evolution."
"> this universe is worth destroying because of all the gruesome, excruciating suffering it has cause to many sentient beings. Alright, let's run with this. This statement is based on the assumption that sentient beings have value *because* causing suffering to them is wrong. Yet you say that... > this universe is worth destroying You cannot believe both at the same time. Either you believe sentient beings have value and that causing suffering to them is wrong or you believe that the universe is worth destroying. For if you destroy the universe, you destroy all sentient beings. Yet you cannot possible destroy the universe, we don't have space travel, so where do you start? Earth. Yet destroying earth is destroying us, sentient beings. You cannot believe both at the same time."

"This is pure speculation, but I think Reddit's demographics are skewed far younger. The people on 4chan either moved on from the platform or matured it while Reddit keeps seeing an influx of teens and very young adults."

Black Lives Matter. Which I'm not sure is even a thing any more. Unless everyone who uses that term has me blocked on Twitter.

Australian feminist Clementine Kill All Men Ford doxes 14 year old boy who told her online to put a shotgun in your [own] mouth.
While Im not supporting the boys choice to say that. Her reaction to dox a child is unforgivable.
"He's 14. He's still a child. Ford is a horrible person. One thing I absolutely cannot stand are people who are cruel to children. She does these things purely to draw attention to herself, and she succeeds, a bit anyway."
"I directly am supporting the boys choice to say that. Society needs to stop this butt hurt culture. I consider offending someone to be a basic free speech right. Although i do not believe that free speech right should then be used as a shield to stop repercussions of being a dick. &#x200B; Clearly the issue here is that her 'repercussions' for him are out of line, doxxing someone is dangerous and is typically inciting violence, which i'm not okay with."
"Its not a butt hurt culture to say that its probably not a good thing to be telling another person to kill themselves. Its never ok and he needs to learn that, apparently you do too."
"Saying something vile, insulting someone or offending them should be a basic free speech right. Inciting violence should not be."

I thought it was wrong when a black individual would snap at being called the N-bomb and start beating the hell out of whoever dropped it. I still think its wrong, but now I can understand the snap response. Its such an ugly, malevolent word, rarely ever spoken outside of its use to convey utter contempt for another race of human beings. But it conveys so much more about the speaker using it in an effort to hurt others than it does those others. It marks a lack of restraint, personal weakness, and little forethought. It marks immaturity for succumbing to that tempting anonymous release of racial hatred. Its a word used by unthinking bumpkins and yokels to mark themselves as such. In this race debate few concessions are made, but one should be to respect the basic humanity for those who are willing to do the same for you. I expect a few people to casually drop the word in the comments, but that doesnt make you clever; it makes you predictable."

Why is it so hard for guys to internalize this? It feels like no matter how times I try to tell myself this I still feel like less of a man for not getting laid on a regular basis

"the most manly thing is to find your dream woman, marry her, and live happily ever after. The constant sex with women is so overrated anyways"
"I was thinking the other day about how many ""successful"" PUA end up with depression even though they are doing better then ever on what they've worked so long and hard for. Then it came to me. If you are adoption behavior that isn't internalized but rather an act to attract women the more successful you are the more it reinforces the idea that the ""real"" you isn't desirable. This is one reason why I believe inner game from authentic changes you make to yourself that attract women is by far the best long term approach."

"Fuck yeah, this sub is great for men to share advice with other men for when it comes to dealing with women. And I suppose these days it's more common for women to be on here as well which is great! But I have found the most use I have gotten out of this sub was in regards to inner game and loving myself. Working on yourself and being consistent with it is the key to success in every facet of life. Women or whomever you wish to attract are drawn to someone who undoubtedly believes in themself."

Why do people defend killallmen and say it's a jokeIf you ever see a killallmen tweet in the replies the poster will say it's a joke. But you can't say killallwomen or you will get banned. They are both hate speech so why does one get banned while the other is treated as a joke
"Start #killallwomen or even worse , use it with the r word and people would lose their mind."
I've heard it explained as it is because you are punching down. Didn't really make sense to me. Seemed to satisfy them.
"Believe it or not you've nailed the mentality perfectly, the reason they don't consider it 'hate speech' is because white men in particular aren't considered a protected class by feminists. In fact they are considered the ultimate privileged class so it's okay to say as nasty shit as possible to them and even encouraged in a lot of cases. Yes it's a load of shit, but this is how they justify it. I was talking about this ages ago but I believe that feminists especially convince themselves men are evil because if they didn't they would feel horrible about the things they know they've done to men in the past. I think this is also why they're so hostile to the idea of people even on this sub even talking about women abusing men because it makes them uncomfortable. They'll either know friends who have done this or they'll have done it themselves, when I think about it like that, it becomes obvious why feminists react the way they do to people calling out women posting KillAllMen."
"Projection is very common. My aggression is ""just"" aggression. Is another part of the equation. Tit for tat. Men just have to keep taking it on the cheek. There was an internal dispute at our human rights commission. One person thought we should also care about men's issues and was pressing that. They had someone research the matter and conclude, no, let's not do that. The caring one pressed the other saying, you can't do this. It is wrong. The other said, Women have suffered under men for over 5000 years. They can get stuffed. Both would describe themselves as feminists."

"Guess whos back? back AGAIN Greenteas back tell a friend Guess whos back, guess whos back, guess whos back.... Lmao okay. So after my temporary ban Im back ! Do you still remember me?"

I was literally thinking about you today
Strange how things happen!

PLEASE!! its the highlight of my day :)
Sis I love your art
"Cute Girl randomly added me on snapchat?This girl added me on snapchat (she had my phone # already), cause we had to do a project for class, were not friends or anything teacher just assigned us before school got quarantined. I haven't heard from her in a few weeks but a few days ago i saw a phone notification and it was her adding me. She said oh hey ____, my phone reset so I lost your phone number. then she asked me something about our class and if we got graded on something. I never gave her my sc ever, but you can add ppl if u had them as a contact. I think the key thing I noticed here is we never had a reason to talk again, and she kinda asked me not that important of a question.. what do u guys think? the only problem is she is very pretty and skinny, seriously she's like a 8-9. I'm the same race as her and I'm not skinny but kind of husky."
Remember the saying dont eat where you shit. If you arent bothered shoot your shot bro.
huh I don't work with her just had a class with her. I doubt we will be in the same classes too next year. yeah I'm wondering if I should but I'm 50/50 on it
"Same aspect applies if youre tied down to something like school and things go wrong theres more chance for it to backfire if handled poorly. Anyway, think to yourself whats stopping you from doing it, then make your decision. Most of the time we just need to push ourselves out of our comfort zone."
School is fineeee. OP shoot your shot. If she rejects you just be respectful and you'll be fine. This isn't work where you're forced to be in close contact with the person at all times.
Yeah school is fine most of the time but its good to let someone know the age old saying for the sake of it. Rumours spread fast and if they arent properly handled youll get burnt.
"Only in High School. If it's decently size college, there are way too many people and as long as you act like a respectable human being, whether things go well or not, you'll be fine."
Be confident she probably added you for good reason dont doubt yourself just feet it out
"Agreed, one step at a time"
"She reached out to you man, just go for it. Try snapping her funny things. I snapped this girl I've been talking to part of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgh0nSkIy04) from Cast Away with the caption ""social distancing got me like"" and it sparked a conversation. Feel free to use it if you want lol"
"People assume any approach is a sexual approach because it's no longer common to have casual friendsApparently a portion of people below the age of 30 think a man inviting a woman over for a drink is a form of sexual harassment. And this mentality appears to have spread to many fields of daily life; if anyone talks to me it's because they want to fuck me. And I thought, why do people think like this now? This idea that if anyone of the opposite sex interacts with you there's a high chance they're just interested in getting you to bed. It's technology and the rise of voluntary self-isolation. That's the cause. Over the past 30 years people in developed countries have learned to spend more time connected to their electronic devices than actually talking to others in bars, cafes, etc. How many people of the overall population spend 3 hours a day chatting with friends, neighbors, coworkers and acquaintances in person? And how many spend 3 hours a day browsing the internet? Even mundane things like talking with your neighbors or trying to spark a conversation at a bus stop. People, especially younger people, just prefer to stick to their phone, and doing otherwise is often seen as an awkward attempt to converse with a complete stranger. Many folks don't even consider the idea because they have no interest in talking to people around them at all. [A study by YouGov found that people below the age of 25 had the fewest friends and the fewest acquaintances](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/07/30/loneliness-friendship-new-friends-poll-survey), meaning they're lonelier than people of older age groups. Every new generation appears to do worse in this aspect so it is safe to assume the generation younger than this one, Generation Z or ""Zoomers"", will be even lonelier. And this definitely has been influenced, very likely to a high degree, maybe even directly caused, by the raise of personal devices. Having friends of the opposite sex that you have no interest in dating or having sex with has become such a rare situation that most people don't even consider that scenario as a possibility. Everyone assumes that if a man shows interest in a woman or if a woman shows interest in a man there must be, by necessity, some sexual interest between the two of them. In fact, this even affects people of the same sex. It is becoming more and more difficult to present [male friendships without people assuming the dudes are gay inside](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/42/51/bb4251056186c8c04dc36e8a76ce0f97.jpg), to the point where folks [insist that two cartoon characters are gay simply to pitch them together](https://www.thegamer.com/stop-lying-nintendo-cj-and-flick-are-gay/). I have seen this among my friends, both women and men: every time two guys show any more affection than a fist bump or a high five several people comment if they're bi or not. My friends laughed at the 1917 movie because for them two guys being friends during war is definitely a sign they're gay. EDIT: This has even affected soooo many comics characters like Wolverine and freaking everyone. You have a social outcast, a depressed loner, a dude from another era who has seen all his friends die and hates himself and struggles to even get by and one day he manages to make a friend despite the brutal depression, like Nightcrawler or Bucky or whatever, and they hang out and tell each other their insecurities and drink beer together and... It's wholesome, they finally made exactly what they needed: a friend. And then a gay writer comes along and goes ""This is going to be sexual now, this is now driven by sexual interests instead of friendship or camaraderie. I know it's toxic to sexualize and romanticize depression and suicidal thoughts, but you know what these characters need? Gay sex."" **Despite the social isolation** and the raise of friendlessness, there is one aspect of life that can never be satisfied without physical contact: sex. People have become less likely to go out to make friends, but more likely to go out to get laid. The impulse to have sex still drives people to talk to strangers and younger generations have become more open about casual sex and approaching strangers with the clear intent of fucking. As a result of this, if you get approached by a stranger in public, the chances of them wanting to be your friend are lower than ever before in history and at the same time the chances of them wanting to bang you are highest than ever before. **Change My View**: People assume the worst of any interaction because wanting to make friends has become less common than ever but openly wanting to fuck has become more common than ever."

Thank you internet
"How do we change your view? You provide no evidence that people view advances as more sexual. You provide evidence people don't have friends. Maybe people approach less for friendship, maybe people don't take approaches as more sexual than they are. Personally I think the opposite is true. I've taken every advance from men as a friendship offer. Then every time they turn it sexual. It really sucks and I feel betrayed when I thought he wanted to be friends and then lay out a love confession on me. Makes me feel like an object."
"I haven't the slightest clue why a man would ever be friends with a random female, much less waste time approaching a random female to become friends with her. Any time I approach a random girl, it's with a romantic interest. And most men I know are the exact same."
"Sometimes they needed a friend who could borrow their parents' car and had a ski pass. Or they needed a squash partner who didn't hit as hard as men. I was also fun to talk to and funny (I know you won't believe that one). Sometimes it's easier to talk to a woman about their love life. Those were legit in high school and college. But as an adult, it's only been guys looking for a girlfriend without being upfront. Part of it is that adult men are desperate and will date anything that moves."
"Exactly, lets be real, any man who approaches a random woman in public approaches primarily because he likes the look of her and he hopes they can fuck one day."
"Also the thing is if you approach with a clear romantic intent, you'll get rejected 99.9999% of the time. Shy men hide their romantic intention until later. It's much better to be clear and not waste the girl's time. If there's any chance you are considering possibly liking her, you should say it at minute 0."
"> If there's any chance you are considering possibly liking her, you should say it at minute 0. It's called OLD and it's not working well for most men."
"Yeah, because you can't manipulate with faux friendship."
"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 12, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger. Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha. Gentlemen, Own Your Shit."
"#OYS 22: Covid Coasting, Quarantine and Calibration Age: 42(m), 43(F) Married: 14 years. 3 kids 12(m), 9(f), 6(f) Height: 6', Weight: 196lbs Diet Mode: HFLC Quarantine: Workout 4/5 times a week. 24kg and 16kg kettlebells. Full body workout. 60/80 minutes. 90sec on 90sec off. Swings, Cleans, Bicep Workout, OHP, Squats, Body Fat: 18% Photo method Read: MRP sidebar Reading: Saved MRP Posts **The Break:** I took a break from the sub for a while. It was recommended by more experienced guys. I couldn't see it at the time but I was clinging to MRP like a life buoy. **Mindset:** I am confident that the work that I am doing is compounding. I can see how I celebrate too early. Instead I will use those times to recalibrate. There is some learned helplessness masked by distractions that I need to deal with. # MAP **Physical:** The home workouts are going well. I will work faster at the gym when it reopens. I will use current frustration to fuel more workouts. **Money and Material Wealth:** The work I was doing before the pandemic is steady. It is more demanding. I will systemise more and dedicate the time to new opportunities. That is what I am going to focus on for the rest of the month of May. My best cash ooportunity is via my creativity. I will set up sales channels for this with the time gained from routinisation. I am a maker. I can make and manage production teams. The review and reorientation process is my least favorite. This because it doesnt feel like making. This effects my earnings and options. I need to incorporate improvement in these phases into my money and management systems. **Comfort:** The comfort I gave myself recently is a few drinks at the weekend. What I am masking is dissatisfaction. I have cut out the weekend drinking to force myself to define what I want more specifically. There is resentment in the lack of looking after myself first. Previously I have either over battled or bailed. Again the need for calibration raises it head. HOA made a comment to the effect You cant create for someone what you havent created for yourself. Well...you can. But it is not good. Weve a saying where Im from, The cobblers children go barefoot. Enough of this. To be congruent you have to build your frame for yourself, not on the promise of favorable outcomes. **DHV:** I was advising on National projects for my countrys response to Covid-19 this coupled with my busy work life, home workout and OYSing has taken on an extra positive halo during the 'crisis'. As the kids say, Im glowed up. But its because of the theatre lights. This adds to dread. Her compliance is increasing and harpiness is decreasing. The current situation is demonstrating to my family and network that I prepared for this type of work reshuffle for years. This is resulting in more efforts to keep me and some shitty comfort tests. I have reread some of J10's posts on Shitty Comfort Tests and managed them accordingly. I have some residual resentment about AWALT. I will channel this in lifting. And into reflecting on my personality and preferences. In addition I have been coasting in the sunlight that comes from not being an autist during a pandemic. It's time to up my game and take advantage of the free roll Covid has given many of us. **Personality and Preference:** This is emerging more. I am making the space to express my preferences by better planning and taking the time to reflect. **Sex:** The sex is always there. I get it when I want it. It's enthusiastic. I'm not here for that anymore. There are things I would like to try in bed but it's not a priority. More precisely, its note a priority with my wife in her current body shape. Her tits look great and BJ performance has improved through more nuance and demonstrable hunger. The only game i am running is asshole game combined with push/pull and healthy doses of stfu. It works fine at the moment. I could add kino. Oneitis is dead but willingness to Nuke the Nuclear Family isnt in play yet. I could do it but would I? Early in this process I would have said yes, but anger would have been the fuel. I may say 'yes' again soon and improved preparedness will be the gate to that transition."

Mystery solved, weight continuing down. A big part of the problem was that I wasn't drinking enough water. ###Financial ... ###Professional ... ###Social I deleted the dating apps, too much temptation for quick validation when I'm bored at work. I have built a schedule for my time. I'll be spending 3 dates a week discovering and working on my covert contracts, maintaining boundaries, Game, Kino, initiation, OI, passing shit and comfort tests from 3+ ""different"" women who all know I'm seeing other women, and developing and maintaining the beginnings of my Frame. ###Mental I couldn't figure out a way to make the leap to internal abundance (non-external based) when it comes to my value to women while sitting in my house being in my own head. Plating was absolutely about seeking external validation at the start and still is to a certain extent, ""proof of concept"" for myself, and I made an extremely risky move that I'm still fighting my way through internally... I could become addicted to the external validation (I'm still working to understand, minimize, and regulate my *desire to be desired* vs having the proper mental model of ""assumed desire"" - *of course they desire me - because I have high value as a Red Pilled man who owns his shit - this one is lucky I'm deciding to gift her with my time and attention*, it is extremely easy to be on the wrong side of that line, or lie to yourself about which side of it you're on) I won't blame anyone but myself if shit hits the fan because of my choices. I've made some progress already, but not the full on critical leaps that are necessary to never need this kind of external proof again. I had the internal realization that women's value of me isn't a worthy measurement of my value, not even this small part of my value, nor is it an accurate one. This is why it is so important to be my own judge in all things. My mental state has quickly arrived at the fact that plating women can't be a mission, not even a side mission, its basically a distraction at best - a ""hobby of interest"" to pass time enjoyably and help one relax after a day spent living a fulfilling life. Women (single women especially) are all desperate to connect to a man who doesn't enervate them, and offers escape from their shitty, lonely existence. AWALT. J10 and u/HornsOfApathy put it well, and as I've been going on dates with these women over the last month while mostly Larping Alfa, the truth of that is crystal clear. The better I embodied that energizing HVM who could offer ""The Great Escape"", the better my dates went. Having an attitude and outlook absolutely overflowing with positivity and life energy (""Abundance"") was extremely attractive to them, whether in a high or low energy environment. I'm not that guy yet, but I'm not exactly Larping him either. He's in me, got buried alive for a while, and I just have to keep helping him grow to become an automatic part of who I am. J10 talked about a hot tub soak. One of my plates has a nice deep tub in her room connected to a standing shower (hers is the master in the house), so after we fucked this last time, I spontaneously had the desire to try it out. As a reward for her, I let her join me for the bubble hot soak. I had her sitting in my lap in the tub, both of us laid back, just relaxing and talking and joking about nothing important. She commented that she ""didn't think it would be this nice"" just to take a bath together. The time I spent at her place was less than 3 hours total, yet that *escape* was there, and was tied to having great sex with me. She was asking before I left if I could stay over, and when she could see me again. The next time she started the bath herself and asked me in. This is like a different kind of dynamite, and I need to treat it with the same care. I hadn't reread HOA's and J10's words prior to reflecting on this week in at least 4 months, and everything I've been doing with this chick and the other 2 has been almost 100% on instinct, very little thinking, so something somewhere must be clicking... the experiences I've had reminded me of their words. Good to reread them and remember what I'm working towards as a starting point for an eventual LTR if one of them vets properly, although not likely. Fuck me... just reread the other parts of HOA's ""Great Escape"" and a staple of what I've been telling my plates from the very beginning is that I don't judge them, I only judge myself. ""No Judgement, No Expectations."" This is basically my catchphrase at this point whenever they tell me some shit they're nervous about sharing because its personal or they give me the cues that they're scared I'm going to ""run away"" because they have faults or whatever. Teaching them that their shit doesn't bother me or affect why I'm spending time with them, I'll just listen and thats it. I better go reread the Fundamentals of Frame posts because these plates are about to do a trust-fall straight through my ""Frame"" and its not going to be pretty if I'm not prepared to hold them in my Frame and they end up hitting the ground. I need to not be a cardboard cutout basically. Its well past time to be a man in more than words."
"###Marriage STBX is having car issues. Keeps dying in random places because she hasn't gotten proper maintenance done on it. I need to reflect on why her negligence with her car maintenance makes me angry... it doesn't put the kids in danger really, just inconvenience and embarrass them and me (at least according to my feelings, and I don't want to make decisions based on that) After reflection I've come to the conclusion that (as usual for me) it stems from my lack of control of the situation. I can't force or coerse STBX to live her life better, and yet she still has an impact on my children in very real and tangible ways. She is their female role model, and I don't like what she models a lot of the time. That said, I need to focus on my own shit before calling the kettle black. I made the appointment for the car and drove her to the bank to get her money. (Her car was fully nonfunctional at this point) Hopefully this puts an end to it IRL, but either way it was another opportunity for me to see inside myself and fix a fucked up thought/feeling. ###Family STFU continues to be a critical part of my life, for a Different reason than most guys here. As previously covered, I rent the second floor of my parent's large home. Large enough that the space over the garage is now STBX's ""apartment"" with me just using the kitchen and laundry, and the space over the rest of the house is ""my apartment"" where I spend the majority of my time when I'm actually home. My parents obviously know that I'm out late several nights a week and for a chunk here and there on weekends, and while my step dad hasn't said anything, my mother has been probing and pressuring consistently. I've taken this as an important part of my growth program, because a large part of my BP conditioning and Nice Guy tendencies came from being raised by her in my early years as a single mother. Mostly I just STFU and ignore her, and I Fog outside of that. She's even gone overt once ""you're not working or running errands or working out this much, so why don't you take 3yo to play with your *friend's* kids? I'm sure they also have some???"" She's trying to Frame it as me missing time with my 3yo, but I'm doing this my way, and the stage of me being out until 9 almost every night will have been short lived. Like I said a few weeks ago, I always knew that my level of activity to create the plates I have now was not sustainable. Her feelings on this are not important. No one needs to know my inner thoughts, my plans, my weakness or my strength. No one. I am the judge of my own actions and I decide what I will do with my time. Had a ""critical moment"" with 3yo this week, from my perspective anyway. Critical more in my evaluation of my own efforts as a parent. Bedtime has been a sore point for me for a long time, and I haven't been consistent here like I have in many other areas of parenting for 3yo. She had riled herself up to throwing a tantrum with mom, refusing to eat her dinner, despite STBX and my own attempts to de-escalate and distract her and get her to listen to us both. She was warned by both me and STBX many times that if she didn't stop, it would be early bed time with daddy. She kept going intentionally, gauging us both. So I took her to bed in my part of the house, spent about 15 minutes patiently but firmly leading her to calm down and stop the crying and screaming and such, then explaining what a consequence is and why she needs to listen to mom and dad, and staying firm through her varied techniques and attempts at getting me to cave and let her go back and finish eating her dinner in the noisy lit up part of the house. She finally fell asleep, and so did I, but even just a week or two ago I would have gotten frustrated that she always wants to be with mom where the screens are always on, and I would have taken her back to STBX and told her to deal with it. This time, while I am still unhappy with how STBX runs her end of bedtimes and continue to express this in the form of suggestions when 3yo is misbehaving, I didn't take my 3yo expressing this preference repeatedly as a personal offense and was amused by it instead - I had empathy for my 3yo and realized if I were in her shoes, I'd prefer mom too (little/no restrictions, stay up late every night, get away with a lot, tablet all the time to keep me out of mom's hair, etc) - but also I understand that as her father it is important for me to be consistent and follow through on things I tell her I am going to do, and teach her to live a life of integrity. I also want to model the type of man she should look for in her adult life, and a HVM doesn't let the mood swings of a toddler get the best of him I owned a little piece of my shit, and its a pretty important little nugget to me. I will stay consistent and build on this small victory."

Classic ego-driven, I don't need this shit, it's dragging me down thinking. I'm incapable of holding myself to account at this point, even without you guys 'dragging me down' and I can see I'm a few weeks from never posting again so it's time to get back at it before it's too late. I'm vaping and drinking more than ever. I'm being a total weak-ass shit about this. It's bugging me endlessly and I can't seem to find the will to make a serious effort just for me. Why bother with anything if I can't do the real basic shit? I won't drink this week (with a target of at least four weeks) and I will stop vaping as soon as I post this. It's a shame I can only do it to please a bunch of strangers on the internet, but it worked last time and I won't go back again. Pathetic whichever way you look at it but I'll take it. These failures lead easily to lots of thinking about what I want in life, what my purpose and mission is, am I simply content to be billy beta and the plough horse. Despite what I might think consciously, deep down I don't think I believe in myself or that I have value or I can do better or deserve it. I do have the power to change that and my 'pleasure' seeking and self-sabotaging ways but it's going to take a long time, I ain't no Horns. I'll use the reality this place presents, as unpleasant as it can be, as best I can. Lock-down is working in my favour and will for a couple more months. I'm saving lots of time and money, my weight is down a couple of Kg, I'm almost hitting 50% protein, I'm eating almost no junk. Physically I feel like shit and exercise is a struggle. I'm weak and the causes are clear because it isn't sleep or diet. I finally really, really accepted I'm skinny fat, hence the good work on the diet. Ditto on being weak, first steps there are the vaping and drinking and simply not having a day off from doing something and sucking up the soreness. Relationships are good, surprisingly so considering lockdown, but I won't fool myself I still don't have a ton of work to do, especially when it comes to application rather than knowledge."

I was holding onto the relationships and that was driving a lot of the negative thought patterns. I havent let go fully yet but Im feeling a lot less guilt/responsibility for her emotions. I am still feeling some and it is changing my behavior but I feel like Im making progress here. Struggling with frustration ex's ongoing shit. She is adversarial and it's only negative on our daughter. She accuses me of shit that isn't true, attacks me for no reason and blames me for everything negative. I have been trying a few different ways of dealing with it but the more she realizes I'm not coming back, the worse it gets. **Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.* I feel like Im rehashing the same shit and not fully internalizing it. Academically understanding something but not able to integrate it into my life. Probably just need time and to pay attendant to the progress I am making. Also, I keep worrying someone on MRP will call me out for not making enough progress. That is outside my locus of control and not something I should worry about but really Im worried because I dont feel like Im making enough progress. Hence my plan to revisit the progress I am making. u/BarracudaRP post, helped me understand why I feel simultaneously like Im faking it and authentic, also he articulated a thought I hadnt been able to which is that that Im doing this to save myself not because its authentically me. Im still driven by wanting to change myself, which considering what Im like is probably a good thing for now. *Mood* still low mood more than I would like, I had about two weeks where I was feeling good, I am still consistently feeling much better than I was and I think this will improve. Today I was feeling bad and thinking about how I would post it here and someone would save me, somehow make it better. Then I just let myself feel bad, I didnt have to do anything with that emotion. I felt immediate much better and free, I still dont feel great today but that letting go of needing to fix it and of the caretaking was a big improvement. Links into below: *Feelings covert contract* last week u/Blarg_Risen pointed out that Im not depressed but that I have (among other things) a covert contract around feeling sad. I have been thinking a lot about this and was playing out a skit in my head when I saw just how deep the covert contract is: I was at my Dads grave and was sad * My partner (who I dont even have in real life) in this skit came up and hugged me/supported me took care of me * I realized the emotion I was imagining was more about eliciting a care response from her than actual sadness and I realized how far I have come from freely expressing myself. I need others validation for my emotions so much more deeply than I thought. * Then I thought about expressing my sadness without trying to elicit a response from anybody and that felt freeing. * Then I got to the bit Im struggling with, I want to be able to express my authentic emotions around others and I do want them to hear them in an appropriate way (e.g. not laugh) and to connect over this. Im not sure how I get to this point, is it somewhere I can get to? *Point of origin* Im still trying to be happy by making life good rather than me good. Every now and again I feel like my life can be whatever I make it and that feels awesome. This can very easily turn to the Shame ->overwhelm cycle below. I have a strong through pattern of me not meeting my own expectations -> shame -> overwhelm -> give up/seek caretaking. Comparing myself to others very often triggers this. Im slowly starting to see emotions are independent of any reactions to the issue. E.g. I was having some emotion about my dad (missing him) then I thought I should do what would make him proud this is the first time (I think) that I have caught myself in this. I realized that my missing him was completely separate to my actions and that I want to make myself proud, separate to that, I miss him. I still want someone to love me, Im still scared of being alone, I dont think Ill be ok with bad emotions etc. **Misc.** Currently Im living at my moms house, the lawyer has advised I stay here until custody is settled as it gives us several advantages and preempts any false accusations from ex. The house is on a corner and basically subdivided with an entry on each street, if I did a few things it would be subdivided. I am considering staying in the other house for 1-2 years after the custody is sorted as it would be good for my daughter and save me time and money (I would still pay rent but cheaper than I could get something equivalent for), if I rented something else I would have to move to a cheaper area and it would be further away from daughters childcare/ex etc. Objectively living there would help me move towards my goals but Im feeling resistance toward it. Im currently reading the monogamous to your mom chapter of NMMNG and I dont think its that as she doesnt try and leech any emotions, doesnt over step boundaries and just generally that chapter didnt resonate with me either time I read it (defense mechanism?). I think its because I imagine bringing girls back and Im living next door to my mom but why do I give a shit what they think? If I was advising a friend I would say, live there, make progress towards your goals and when you have achieved xyz (I have some specific ones in mind) then you will have the money to afford a place where you want. Who gives a shit what other people think, but Im not advising a friend and I cant separate the issues in my head here."
"**Breaking Free Activity 18**: Identify a gift you initially resisted, any gifts you need to surrender to right now. Initially: basically all failure/hardship. Ray Dalio said pain + reflection = growth. Friends in high school, trial, etc. Many things I can think of. Now: Ex shitiness, this is an opportunity for me to practice and grow so I can become the man I want to be and have what I want in my life. **Breaking Free Activity 19:** One area where you routinely feel frustrated or out of control. Are you trying to project the reality you want onto the situation? If you had to accept the reality of this situation, how might you change your response to it? Relationships/women I want the bluepill fantasy, I want to life happily ever after, I want there to be something more than survival of the fittest. If I had to accept this, which Im currently trying to do, I would treat online dating as marketing, I would accept I wont be loved like that but that I dont need to be and accept there is no relationships destination where I can relax and just be me. Separation Im still having a hard time accepting this, it ties into the above, Im holding onto the blue pill fantasy and ignoring reality. The reality is, she did thinks regularly that crossed my boundaries, I let her from the start and doesnt offer that much in a relationship. If I accepted all this then I would let go and move on, acknowledge my tendency to only remember the good and remind myself of the bad, accept that I might have been able to make it work had I been less of a faggot but its too late now. Life I want there to be a meaning to life but I know there is only the meaning you make. It feels pointless that we just life to reproduce and die, I want there to be something more. If I accepted this I would do more of what I want, for me, not some false obligation to society or anybody else. I would care less what they thought of me, angry selfish, whatever the accusations, I would just life for me and what I want. Daughter I have fear that Ill lose her somehow, death, ex stopping my access etc. And I might. If I accepted this I would have less anxiety. **Breaking Free Activity 20** guidelines for feelings. Read, try to keep in mind. Some comments, feelings are separate to the issue, I make them one and the same, you can have a feeling with no obligation to do anything and without it meaning anything. I am scared to have feelings, I am scared of having bad feelings that I cant handle and just any feelings but by stopping them I actually feel much worse. I am not even able to feel safe in my own feelings, how is a woman supposed to be safe in me? **Breaking Free Activity 21** list one fear that has been controlling your life. Use affirmations I can handle it, no matter what happens, I will handle it until you take actions and stop feeling fear. * Moving on form the separation. * My daughter dying. * Starting a business. **Breaking Free Activity 22** Identify one area that is out of integrity. Identify the fear. Truly moving on from ex, I would fantasize about her sexually and indulge fantasys of us getting back together. I would use this to avoid feeling negative feelings about the relationship and family breaking down. I am scared I am making a mistake, that my daughter will suffer as a results, that Ill regret my decision, that I will be alone and not able to have what I want. I think this is being driven by; I dont back myself and I fear exs actions. I still dont have the confidence that I can make my life whatever I want (although I get glimpses of it). Fear 2: I fear starting/taking on something big. I am scared it will overwhelm me and Ill quit. That I will fail and be laughed at. As a kid, my family went bankrupt due to a business venture and I think I associate that to trying something myself. Considering my current situation, I think the best plan is to spend a few more months getting my shit sorted and starting something on the side. From there I can reassess."
"**OYS 41** Age 64 Ht 5'11"" Wt 168 Wife 66 Married 43 Together 46 **Reading** TRM(v2) \[starting v3\] **Physical** Began the ninth (or tenth?) repeat of the 3-month-long Athlean-X program I bought a couple years ago. It has been money well-spent. Having an ""official program"" that spells out what to do every day is great for discipline, and reviewing the prep videos is always motivational. Also there is enough variety and intensity in it to keep it challenging - except I don't get the same variety with just home equipment. Next week we're told gyms open! I've also finished my first run thru the Core 4 Abs program and restarting it. As part of getting my blood pressure under control the doc had me quit taking Naproxen. Consequently my joints ache all the time. Let's me know I'm still alive. New diet seems to be helping with weight, though, which is good. **Work / Financial** About a month ago just as the lockdown started I was transferred / matrixed to two women. I always ask ""what else do you need? What else should I be doing?"" etc. This week I find out one of them is complaining (not to me, of course) that I'm not doing what she wants. I contact her and ask her to tell me which team I should be working with, which of course she doesn't do. So now begins the recovery and ""alignment"" process. More importantly, trying to avoid being fired in this current work climate. **Mindset** This work situation is not unusual. There's always some executive somewhere looking for a reason to be upset. The tension is the ""edge"" for consultants. You never want to be too comfortable, you'll miss something. Also you need to continually be ready that any given Friday they can say ""don't come back Monday"". Its happened before and it will happen again. Sort of like the Stoic practice of thinking through the pre-fail or worst outcome as a way to mentally ground yourself. **Relationship** This part of my life is great. If I didn't know she had had a complete hysterectomy 25 years ago I'd say she must be ovulating. Extremely aggressive sexually. Sildenifil is my friend."
"**OYS #34** Lockdown ending this week week 9 Stats: 40 yo, height 186 cm, weight 85 kg, bodyfat 16% navy method, wife 39 yo, living together for 13 years, married for 8. Kids are 3 (girl) and 6 (boy). Home workout stats: Q&D protocol by Pavel Tsatsouline, usually with a 20kg kettlebell 3 times per week. This week was pussy week, however. **Readings:** Sidebar books read: MMSLP, NMMNGx2, WISNIFG, RM, TWOTSM, MAP, Saving a low sex marriage, Bigger Leaner Stronger, Pook. Books read that are not on the sidebar: Bigger Leaner Stronger, Leangains, Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, The Quick and the Dead Now reading: Fuccfiles, SGM Reading queue: Day Bang, 48LOP **Shit to own** *Health:* In his books Pavel Tsatsouline calls the 48kg kettlebell The Beast. In keeping with the tradition, I will call the 12 kilo bell The Pussy. Long story short, I injured my back and switched to The Pussy for this weeks workouts. It happened after waiting in line for a long time with shitty posture reading SGM on my phone. Bad KB swing form could be a contributing factor, or it could be the extreme back flexion required until recently to put my daughter to bed. Constant 4-5 level pain in the very low back near the hips, on the right-hand side, with the occasional flashes of 8-9 when I tried to bend over or get up from bed. Lasted for 2 days and then subsided but did not completely go away. For two days, putting on socks or tying my shoes was a challenge. I pulled out Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, the chapter on hip hinge and proper form with the swing and did all the exercises with The Pussy two-handed. Yesterday did the same, with the 20kg kettlebell. Back felt fine. I decompress the spine by hanging from a bar at least once per day, I do hamstring stretches and try to avoid flexion of the spine as much as possible. I might even go to the doctor as an extreme measure, if all else fails. Gyms will maybe open later this week. If so, I will do the first barbell workout this weekend and keep it light. Key takeaway: Im dealing with the back pain without being a miserable whining pussy, esp. with the wife. *Relationship (contains action item from last week):* So I play this game where I initiate at least two times per week and I win if my initiation was good according to me. Actually, its according to my dick if it gets hard, the initiation was good. I continue to watch out for diminutive words and Im being successful like 80% of the time. By above mentioned measure I did one low quality initiation and one high quality, both did not result in sex because the wife was tired or something. But the sexual pressure got to her so during the say she started giving me IOIs and coming to me for a kiss and an ass grab and eventually initiated sex herself. It was exactly like my standard Nice Guy initiations, only with the roles reversed: I asked her for a back rub because my back was sore, she gave me a good enough back rub and then started escalating with kisses all over my back and shoulders, getting naked and grinding her pussy on my ass and hips. I threw her down, ate her out, did a quick 69 where she licked my balls and then fucked missionary. Barely managed to last long enough and she came several seconds after me, which means I had to pump away with the post-cum erection. P.S. Sex makes the back pain worse. I had so much fun eliminating dimunitive words, I am going start another game speak slowly, with a strong tone, eliminate verbal bullshit. Key takeaway #1: at some point I switched from seeking validation from my wife to seeking validation from random Internet faggots. Takeaway #2: I need to improve my Immersion first before focusing on the D, E, or V. Also, jerk off more often so that I can last longer. *Work (action item from last week):* this week my company returns to the office full time. I stay till late in the office and focus on clearing the to do list. *Kids:* I am doing a better job of setting boundaries before I lose my shit. I am also keeping cool when my wife loses her shit over the kids misbehaving. She has a much lower threshold than me. The son wanted me to buy him a new game to play on his Android. Its a gigantic sum of money, around 10 euros. I wanted to buy it and use it as a reward for some desired behavior. I decided it should not be something he is supposed to be doing anyway, so I think I found the perfect solution: the son now has to demonstrate to me and the wife how he plays the free version of the game and stops playing when we tell him to stop. I told him in order to buy you a good video game I want to see that you are able to control your addiction. We use the words phone sickness with him. *Thoughts on SGM:* the #1 thing Ill remember from SGM it the notion that women need sex more than men. It may or may not be true, but its a great frame to adopt when dealing with the wife, as in: I am giving her the gift of fucking. **Goals till May 19th next week** New: Eliminate verbal bullshit, speak slowly and deliberately Get back to 15% BF or below <-- getting there Own the 20kg kettlebell 100 reps one-handed in 5 minutes <-- fuck, not gonna happen Keep initiating and DNGF <-- going OK so far start one of the game books (Day Bang?) and try out stuff on the wife <-- might have to postpone the deadline **Mission/ long-term stuff** Stop giving a fuck what others think, switch to internal validation Become a high energy charismatic guy. Prioritize my career and be successful in my current role, which is essentially running a business within the company Help my kids grow confident and strong, so that they make the big life decisions driven by ambition as opposed to driven by fear"

The call was just a routine checkup. They have a secret language set up for one to bail out the other if the date isn't going how she wants.
Holy shit. Never thought of such a tactic. Thanks for the enlightenment bro.

She is not into you and her friend came to rescue her.

"a perfect solution to those problems was the old school mafia, who kept the streets clean from trash like her. the old yakuza used to be like that...scum like that died pretty quickly. we should bring that back since it seems is needed at this point."
"The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of ""no innocents"" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and ""reminded"" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. The ""protection money"" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office... At which point donations are made to the campaign. Really.... You can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles. The 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all Tony Soprano was basically the coming of age, angsty teenager stage. It matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now."
A friend on mine works in the court system. I told her about this. She said if the men came forward and made a complaint she probably would be prosecuted.
[removed]
Wow. Really illustrates just how blatant the double standards are.
She had ONE somewhat marginal song. Dont see the attraction. Just another wannabe hood rat.
"Yet our degenerate society praises her and allows her to make millions when she can barely spell her own name, and her only contribution to society is trash, ghetto club music."
Don't forget that after she drugged them she let her gay friends sexually assault them too.
Just imagine the sleazy advances she had to have made to get those guys to follow her. It's actually pretty pathetic to imagine her throwing herself at some guy.
"Set up a swingers date with you and her, plus her new boyfriend and his LTR. Except you could swing from her to her new boyfriend. Seriously though, you sound overly concerned. She's trying to make you jealous. Just ignore. If you ever do find out that anything happens between them, drop her like a hit potato."
I actually jokingly asked what his girl looks like lol
"Not sure I agree. If OP's LTR is hot she must get hit on constantly. Her telling him about it this time may well be based in guilt or she's trickle truthing because she's having thoughts about it. Still, hard to say."
"bro just keep doing your thing and don't pay any attention, let her shut him down... she knows what she has to do.. now if it turns into him touching her and waiting by the car in the parking lot and other creepy forceful shit, is. he shows her nudes of his ltr cuz she's bi then I'd just smile and not tell her anything and show up at her work and talk to this fucking guy assertively and hint to him on fucking the fuck off"
"This is good advice, other option is to befriend this dbag. Like go out of your way to meet him then invite him to something just you two without the girls. Personal relationships have a way of diffusing threats."
idk man... happily ever after seem possible but im cynical and believer; shes not yours its just your turn. benefit of the doubt shes loyal and it ends theres plenty girls turn down advances. but this guy already has an eye for your girl. clearly she is not bothered by it. shes guilty its happening not that it happened to her. she could have shut it down instantly but she gave in. HE knows this he wanted his foot in the door he got it he may have the door shut on him now. but hes there baybe. just waiting. THE real question is: how long can she hold off???? that there is the real answer to your question. get that answer and you have your answer. and you and me both know game knows game and when you got a target. cut off some time with her and make the available time meaningful she probably has too much access to you and is bored you got what you wanted so you try less everyday except feelings grow one or the other has to go.
"Man, if your girl is attractive at all, this kind of thing happens all the fucking time. Literally all the time. In the past week alone, I went to make a purchase with my LTR. Because she didn't want to meet up one-on-one with a random guy from the internet. Know what happened? After she bought shit from him, he spammed her phone with messages asking if I was her BF, if she was interested, if she wanted to add him on social media, blah, blah, blah. And I was there and she said maybe two words to this man. I handled the transaction. And that was one of two times THIS WEEK something like that happened. You're looking at this wrong. If you're with an attractive girl, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Get used to it or start dating uggos. Stop fearing the competition--be above it. If you're with a hot girl, you should ALREADY be above most of the competition. It shouldn't matter. Treat yourself like you're #1. There will be rare instances where you need to put a guy in his place. I've had to a couple times myself. But by and large, most of these scenarios you don't need to concern yourself with."
"what will it be boys, gay or a rapist?"
Letting a drunk girl sleep in his bed was already a huge mistake. He never should've allowed such a large and unnecessary risk into his life.

I just spent the last 2 hours googling for a working link to a JAV I remembered fapping to 13 years ago. This is my Sunday night.
I respect the hustle
"The nostalgia, but man, this hits hard"
i remember this super great video on youporn like 12 or 13 years ago (at least i remember it being awesome) that was an asian girl solo in red lingerie. it's not there anymore and over the years i could never find it so it's just lost to time.
Good vids can be hard to find sometimes.
send me the link if you find it
Bro find better copes. This shit does u no good.
"Well, did you find it?"
This is funny because I've done the same and I hate myself for it.
"Op, inceldom is a state of mind. No, you can't be pretty, but you don't have to make yourself suffer. You could do anything, you have the internet. If you couldn't play games, or jack off for the next week, what would you do?"
"What is your option on MensLib?I have found that, different to MRAs they actually focus on real harm towards men, at often times through a feminist perspective. What do you think? Edit: I appreciate your comments everyone! Ill try to get into said group :)"
We send people there all the time.
"Good, MensLib is a great place to get MRAs to see that you don't need to be misogynistic to fight for ending men's woes."
The only masculinity-focused place that's not anti-feminist but pro-men.
Love it. Strongly recommended.
I think its really cool and it helps me balance out my man hating feelings. Seeing men talk about their emotions feels really really good
Hard same. It does bring a humanizing perspective and helps me remember that their relative privilege isn't without cost. I also appreciate and respect that they made a space for themselves rather than asking women why we aren't creating more space for men in women's spaces.
"Im glad for you! I can see that since, as a guy, back when I was going to group therapy I didnt really understand its purpose and tended to be irritated by it. Thanks for the feedback!"
I learn so much there. Its a place where you can actually learn about the problems men face without getting it all muddled up with women-hate.
"Overall a great community, though I do think they can lose perspective with regard to their privilege at times."

"They're not gonna do a thing because: 1. It's a Western game. Sony's HQ is now in California, as well. Their bias for Western media over Asian media has been on blatant display for over a decade. 2. Ellie is a gay white woman. That basically puts her at the top of the progressive stack (forget what they say about any ""minority"" group; women always come first, especially alphabet soup women). 3. Actual gamers are upset about the situation. Since gamers are always wrong, that means it's a non-issue! So yeah, there's pretty much no chance that Kotaku, Polygon, IGN, GameSpot, Eurogamer, etc... are gonna come to bat for the YouTubers who are unfairly being silenced for *reporting on an actual situation*."

Why would they be upset at Sony helping take out some of their rivals or actually call that out? I mean do you expect integrity and moral fibre from mainstream gaming sites or something
"I'd figure they took out some cis white males, that has to be good fodder for some SJW angle......"
"Bet cbr gonna write this instead ""10 hot scissors position you wish you can do with ellie"""
"Out of interest, did you use ""clean"" computer to do this? Because Google favors showing you results from sites you like, not from all sites.

This isn't random. He's looking to see what the 'mainstream gaming sites' have said.
"Mental bandwith to listen, note body language, AND be flirty?I've got a problem with my metal bandwith. Over text I can be very flirtatious and escalate. Then when I go on the date, knowing this is supposed to lead to a hookup, I fail to escalate and make a move because I am so distracted by actively listening to the conversation and paying attention to body language that we have a fun conversation and that's it. She drops hints, but because my mental bandwidth is maxed out, I can't respond to them in the same way I would over text, when my mental bandwith is hardly being used at all. I can only do two things at a time, and here I'm required to do three. * I listen, but ignore body language to be flirty and make moves, but screw it up because it's unnatural and ill-timed (because I'm not paying attention to body language). * I pay attention to body language and try to make natural, well-timed moves, but now I can't keep the conversation going and things fall flat. * I listen and keep the conversation going, and I pay attention to body language, but I'm too overloaded for flirtatiousness to enter my mind. One of those three scenarios, most recently the last one, have been *consistently* cockblocking me when I should be already in. All of my successes have been with extremely high-interest women who forgive those mistakes. ""Practice makes perfect."" In this case, it doesn't seem that way. In the past 6 months my text flirting has gone through the roof, but in the same period my in-person flirting has gone **nowhere**. How do you guys increase your mental bandwith for this?"
"I think if you've already gotten the body language and have entered into flirting, where she is reciprocating, you don't really need to pay attention to body language that closely anymore. I think you're overthinking this longer than you need to."
"But you still need to pay attention to body language to calibrate as you flirt and escalate. The last time I entered flirting and ignored body language to continue flirting, I didn't calibrate properly and made her uncomfortable, which I did not realize until I replayed the interaction in my head a few hours later and realised that I wasn't noticing her body language at the time."
"I don't think these aspects are as separate, or hard to parse, as you're making them out to be. Do you have a hard time reading people, generally? If she's smiling, complying, being suggestive etc. then keep escalating. To me, body language is most important when you're trying to build rapport and get her receptive to you. If she's having a good time with you then escalate. I'm sorry, I don't see the difficulty."
">Do you have a hard time reading people, generally? Yes and no. I've had so many occasions where I read someone as being disinterested when they were interested, or interested when they weren't. So many occasions where they're smiling and complying, saying they had a great time, but then ghost me after the first date. Or I go for a kiss and get rejected. Even online sometimes, we'll be flirting and she'll be suggestive back, then out of nowhere I'm blocked or unmatched. That all makes me feel like I suck at reading people. I can neither trust my gut instinct to read them, nor can I trust them to be giving genuine signals. But that's also a sligtly separate issue than my mind drawing a complete blank when it comes to being flirty in-person."
"One other contributing factor, is that I cannot multitask conversation with anything else. I'm either paying attention to the conversation and doing other things on autopilot, or running the conversation on autopilot (and not retaining any information) and doing my other thing. Over text, the conversation is always there so I can go back and reference it. Verbally, I have to put conscious effort into retaining what someone said long enough to address it and keep the conversation going. That conscious effort robs me of the bandwith to be flirty."
"Is it a real question? If you date a girl, fuck all theory and just begin to touch her politely,, then more heavily and then fuck her. **IF SHE ISN'T RECEPTIVE TO TOUCH, SHE IS NOT ATTRACTED TO YOU!** That is an **axiom**! So find an other girl and repeat. Simple!"
That has nothing to do with my question.
"Absolutely has, however!"
"You only addressed physical touch, which I did not ask about. I'm asking about verbal flirting."
Denuvo launches its own Kernel-level Anti-Cheat for Doom Eternal. It resulted in locking out Linux users on Steamplay/Proton.

Reports of it locking out people who were playing the game on Linux: https://i.imgur.com/sHwy0yw.png https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3773#issuecomment-628748877
I wonder what r/linux_gaming has to say about this.
It's not just Linux owners who'd be affected. Not when Denuvo's anti-cheat would make PCs more vulnerable with glaring security breaches.
"So the game didn't have this at launch. Valve invested time making sure the game ran smoothly in Proton. Linux users bought the game because it worked nicely on Linux. Then they add DAC 2 weeks later, making the game unplayable on Linux. People ask for refunds and the requests are denied, even though they can't use the product they've paid for. It's credit card charge back time. I actually wish I'd bought the game so I could complain to the ACCC. Would love to see them fuck Bethesda, id, and Denuvo."
"I don't know how, but they're somehow managing to turn Eternal into a shitshow after an amazing release. Between this, locking levels behind Twitch Prime subscriptions and the whole soundtrack clusterfuck, it's like they're determined to fuck the game up."
locking levels behind TWITCH subs? But I hate twitch.
"Yep. They keep releasing new levels post-release, and promised that they'd all be free. The most recent one is only playable if you have a Twitch prime account. Even if you paid several hundred dollars for the Collector's Edition (like me), you still can't play it if you don't have Prime. It's infuriating that companies can pull shit like this."
"New Mother Needing Advice On CopingHi Red Pill Wives! I'm really in need of some advice in this very trying time of my life. Well, I don't know if I need advice, a slap in the face, a shoulder to cry on, or just to commiserate - I guess I just need some context. My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and we have a 7.5 month old son. I'm really struggling with the transition from purely homemaker to include being a stay-at-home-mom. My husband works a great job and we have always been in agreement that our ideal situation would have me staying at home looking after our children. I feel like I'm currently not meeting my own expectations or my husband's expectations of what I should be doing at this point. The first few months were absolutely survival, we both knew that going into it, but now that we've found more of a routine with the baby I'm struggling even more now that there's more expectations of me. The idea that there's zero ""time off"" from motherhood is really eating at me in a way I hadn't anticipated. I end up feeling slightly resentful and come off as ungrateful to my husband when his job ""ends"" and he gets a break in the evenings. He frequently works on things at home (he'll VPN onto work and check things during some evenings and on weekends) so it's not that he only works during the day and lounges for the rest. However, I get up and cover anything that our son needs between bedtime (around 7pm) and I'll get up anywhere between 6-8am and look after him for his first wake-window. Neither of us are morning people, so I find myself envying my husband who gets to stay in bed until 9 or 10. Partially for the sleep, but partially because he gets the opportunity to stay up late to enjoy his hobbies where I feel pressure to get to bed early so I'm not absolutely dead for a 6am wakeup. We counter this problem once in a while by my husband taking the first wake-up. I'll get up and feed our son and he'll get up and spend an hour or two with him so I can get back to bed. This is usually a great treat but it's not feasible for him to do it super often and I feel a lot of guilt asking him to get up earlier on a work day or after I know he's been up late. A lot of things I previously enjoyed as a homemaker (cleaning, cooking, general errands) don't bring me joy in the same way now that it's a juggling act with a baby. Even though I really enjoy making food for my husband, I get frustrated and anxious about getting groceries or meal planning and frequently ask if we can get take-out instead, which in turn makes me feel like I'm doing a bad job. I try and stay on top of the laundry and dishes pretty well, but the overall state of our house is not something I'm proud of. My husband is an absolutely awesome dad and he's so willing to be involved and help when he can around his work schedule. I honestly love being a mom too, it's just been really hard that I don't feel like I get to be anything but a mom anymore. I'm half and half breastfeeding and pumping (about 4x each per day). If the baby isn't up, I'm usually hooked up to my breastpump, cooking/doing dishes, or doing laundry. I get a couple hours in the evening where I can take part in my hobbies, but by that point I'm usually so exhausted that I crash and get to bed as soon as possible. Any energy for physical intimacy with my husband is almost a distant memory at this point. Anyways all of this aside I just feel like there's a normal amount of adjustment to being a new parent, but I feel like I'm on the verge of just not coping whatsoever. I'm having multiple breakdowns a month and I feel like I'm putting a lot of extra burden on my husband. Is it just going to be hard until baby is X months/years old? I feel some added pressure since my husband is facing a possible big promotion where his workload will increase drastically and he won't be able to help as much as he is now. We also want more kids eventually, but I'm barely hanging on with one as it is. My husband was speaking to an older work colleague over the phone the other day and they were discussing a conference that was moving to online. They have evening discussions and my husband said that he'd try and be present once our baby was down for the night. The colleague was surprised that I wouldn't be able to handle doing that by myself and asked what I would be doing if he was having to travel and be at conferences in person. That's been eating at me for a little bit ever since it came up. The last couple of times my husband had to travel for work, my parents came to stay with me to help out (we're in the US and they're in Canada, so they've had to cancel all pending travel for the time being). For those of you that have kids, do you have any tips on how to cope with the big life change? Did I just miss the boat on maternal selflessness that other women figured out before they had kids?"
"Big hugs! I don't have kids, but I have done a lot of research into this situation, and witnessed it with my friends. &#x200B; You've gotta remember, historically, women were NOT alone during this time. Their husbands might be working - but they had neighbors, extended family, and usually older children to help out. You're doing it on your own! Realistically, it's an absolute slog (no matter how much you love it). Can you get some help from your mum or mother in law, or a friend, or a neighbor? Can you hire a babysitter once or twice a week? &#x200B; In terms of communicating with your husband: it's okay to tell him that you're struggling with being on-call 24/7. It would feel like your body isn't your own - I know that being 'touched out' is something a lot of mums feel. You need self-care - a bath by yourself, a chance to read a book out of earshot of crying, etc. A good man will understand that!"
"Full disclosure, I am not the red pill type and stumbled across this post. I am however a mother of two and I feel your struggle so hard. Mine are 8 and 5 and it does get better as they grow and gain some independence. You'll find time more time for yourself and your partner. You're breastfeeding and running a household, that's an enormous amount of work and it's a 24/7 job. Feeling like you're a failure or losing yourself is normal, it happens to us all but it's not a part of motherhood that's openly discussed. I do worry about you mentioning frequent breakdowns. Have you been screened for post partum depression or anxiety? Your OBGYN should be able to help. For practical advice, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. I mean for everything. Make a couple of hours a week after the baby is in bed for you and your husband. Take some you time. Even if its getting up fifteen minutes earlier to enjoy a cup of coffee alone. Those alone minutes can be the difference between staying calm and losing your shit entirely. If you're able, hire a babysitter one night a month for a date with hubby. Remember it's okay to ask for help. I waited until my youngest was three to hire a nanny and she's a godsend. Her creativity and input is well worth every penny I've spent and she's become an invaluable part of our family. And finally, this to shall pass. All of the struggles you have are temporary and you'll be okay. Your baby will be okay if you're not perfect and so will hubby. Don't compare yourself to other moms or families. You're doing great. Also, it's totally okay to hide in the bathroom and cry for a minute when it's overwhelming."
"First of all - with all of our kids I was a mess for a year. I had issues with hormones and PPD coupled with not sleeping? I was an absolute wreck. My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep. Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? You really need some self care. There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break. Theres nothing wrong with that. I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes. The thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you. You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband). The infant is a full time job that never ends. The house and being a homemaker is a full time job. There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup). Figure out what you need. One day a week of sleeping in? 3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend? I cant answer the question for you. But what you ARE doing isnt working. Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week. How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need. YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife. You, my dear, are human. If after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it. You could have Post Partum Depression. A couple of books I really like : Replenish by Lisa Byrne Say Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine The transition into motherhood is a hard one. I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night. Its okay that you arent okay right now. Edit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can. I realize it may be hard. But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference. Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day."
"It's tough having a baby. It will get better. I have made a habit of not working beyond finishing dinner or fixing a quick/easy one and putting said food away. I put the children to bed and I do my best to relax/spend time with my husband. I would start adjusting baby's schedule and yours to align with your husband's. Can you put the child in your room to make things easier? Feed the baby and everyone goes back to sleep. Pumping while breastfeeding is quite unpleasant. When I did it, I wanted to just give formula. I would stop pumping unless someone needs to watch your LO while you're away. Has baby started solids? That would be beneficial to you. I loved those yogurt melts for my son. Look into baby-led weaning, so that you don't have to sit there and fight him with a spoon. 7.5+ months is a perfect time to start playdates. Even if you're the parent hosting or watching the children, you can go somewhere like a child friendly coffee house or park to escape. Children love playing outside, on playgrounds, and with toys they don't have at home, even if they go to see those specific toys weekly. Getting out of the house in general is helpful for one's sanity. As far as housework goes. Declutter and minimize possessions! Best thing I've done. I have yet to organize and strategically place everything, but I can totally see how that will only improve our lifestyle at home and cleanliness/tidiness. Ask for help. If you can afford even 1 hour of help a week, it would be worth it. Get into a routine and schedule. With good habits you can do such things as unloading the dishwasher in the few minutes that it takes to make your coffee. Don't be afraid to let your son watch a bit of TV. When he is older, give him chores and tasks to help! I agree with the other commenter, as well. You must discuss this with your husband. At the very least he should be respecting your desire to go to sleep earlier. I, personally, find it quite difficult to sleep without mine in the bed with me. Now, his computer is in our bedroom, so the lights and sounds from gaming make it challenging to sleep. If he's up late, so am I."
"Please dont be too hard on yourself. I went through the same thing when I had my first baby last year, I felt like I was failing for the first 8 months, it was a difficult transition for me as well. Some days it was a good day if I just managed to get myself dressed. Its not easy at all, but it will get easier. And some days are still like that. Its a tough adjustment. If youre worried about your homemaking and house keeping, I would look into zone cleaning and FLY lady, she has really good tips for beginners. Another good tip is to do something for yourself each day, it will make you a happier wife and mom, sometimes that might just be getting dressed; others it might be doing your hair etc. things will get better! Youre doing great, all you really need to focus on is taking care of you and your baby!"
"Get your hormone levels checked. Especially thyroid if you are RH negative. Secondly, reach out to other women with babies your owns age, you are not alone. Forums online were a lifesaver to me. ""Due date clubs"". Is your baby colicky or has sleep issues? That can be extremely stressful."
What is the connection there? I am rH negative so just curious. Ive not heard that before.
"Personal theory, but I think the Rogam shots caused an autoimmune response that destroyed my thyroid. Went dead and I had to have it removed it was so diseased and causing storms. Life threatening. It was awful."
"Have you ever thought about putting your baby on a flexible feed wake sleep schedule like Babywise? Although not perfect all of the time this could give you alot of an amount of expectation for how the day goes especially if your baby is waking through night, which makes you, in-turn, exhausted. Also, do you have any parents close by to help?"

Where did this myth start? I know really unhealthily thin women dont get their periods is that what it is? Or do they think a period is like the kidney washing out toxins?
"Women who are high performance athletes or who have eating disorders often do lose their periods. If I had to guess, Id say the myth is probably related to what some men perceive has healthy/thin women."
"Oh that makes sense. High performance athletes is one thing but, venerating eating disorders? How admirable"
Very stressful situations can make them stop too. Mine stopped during basic training and didn't start back until I was almost done with tech school which was like another 2 months. I even went to the doc on base at tech school and got the third degree about possibly being pregnant even though I did not have sex while at tech school.
"Oh jeez Im so sorry that they assumed that. It really shows how a lack of information about something as simple as stress delaying periods can lead people to be like WOW YOU MUST BE PREgnanT HUH? Now that I think about it, my period was very late around the time I first started running, and it also tends to be late when Im having finals week panic attacks. Ah, the joys of being female"
"Right! Stress causes late period, stress because period is late.... Vicious cycle"
Pretty sure
Ya because a lot of them had a baby every goddamn year
"Do you think that evil women face more hate than evil men ?I am asking that question, because I noticed that subs like iamatotalpieceofshit, trashy, etc... often make it to the front page with a woman. Now Im not saying that women only are being brought to the front page, but its something that I see quite often. And Im not talking about the misogynistic comments that men dont face in such threads. Anyway I just wanted your opinion on that, or if you noticed something similar, because I cant quite see the whole phenomenon by myself"
We had a pretty good discussion about this here not too long ago. I think it's worth discussing again but if you were interested here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/fqk70d/do_you_agree_with_the_statement_society_is/
"Oh I didnt even think about checking if that was discussed, sorry"
"No I think this isn't something that's discussed often, so like I said I think it's worth another post"
"Definitely yes. The bar for what it takes for a woman to become the target of an internet pile on is so much lower than the bar for a man. A few examples off the very top of my head: - disproportionate negative attention to the women in Trumps cabinet, despite so many of the men being just as bad if not worse - women becoming the face of anti-mask/anti-lockdown protests despite men being statistically more likely to not wear masks - anger at semi-prominent people who didnt do social distancing well enough was almost exclusively aimed at women - women who support Biden being criticized based on the allegation against him when similarly-positioned men are not"
"I think that due to the traditional view that women are caring and nurturing, when we do evil things that subvert that view the reaction is worse because we are seen as going against our nature."
