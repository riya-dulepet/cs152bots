"Damn, I saw a movie in which the old woman bathed in the blood if virgins to do this. How did no one tell her she just needed some water."
"Okay but even if this wasn't a stupid hyperbolic tantrum, congenital deformities are less the persons fault than disease. Yes, sometimes you get a disease by no fault of your own, but never has somebody had a congenital deformity as a direct or indirect result of something they chose to do. This idiot cant even logic right in his own entitled fantasies. Hes more stupid than a ""foid"" is. Big oof."

> The problem is that they removed the urinals in the men that became mix and that most girls at the end are the ones that complain. Assert dominance. Leave seat up.
But using the urinals in front of girls that are waiting is even more dominance. But truly my complain is because is way slower now
"There's no way he would want to have sex with those ugly ghetto whores.One of them claimed her assailant was a short black man which Holtzclaw obviously isn't.The only DNA was from convicted criminal Adaira Gardner who told her mom she wanted to go out with Holtzclaw because he was a ""hot cop."" The case is a fucking fraud."

If I knew how to I would open my own subreddit called... Men boycotting woke women. Just to see how they respond to that!!!
BoycottPoon is short and sweet. GuysAgainstGash

Lol I can tell your just a mad women who thinks she is entitled to marriage. Awwww has someone past their prime and now regretting the cock carousel ride they took .
You mean women marry and divorce for financial gain??? Never! /s
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA stupid cunt
"They want our money and peace of mind. I say, come and get it!"
"Idk any woman who was sexually assaulted, but I do know a couple of men who were victims of false accusations. People need to stop believing what theyre told & believe their own eyes."
"Dudes.....we now have video camera's that can be hidden or worn as glasses (for those that already wear them, most people won't notice). Check your local laws for video and then use them to document the bullshit happening with these women. Put camera's in your house and by your door and driveway, etc. to record the fucking lies happening from her side....it might literally save your life one day. There are many posts on there of guys using camera's to get out of really bad false accusations. This is the kind of advice more men should read and take and it should be posted here when it's used effectively. MGTOW for LIFE! PS - Johnny Depp DID use video to boost his case against this crazy bitch he is divorcing."

"I literally have to videotape every moment I spend with my daughter because of all of the insane false accusations my ex continues to make against me. In Family Court, I am guilty until proven innocent, and I have spent a fortune in court trying to clear my name with video evidence. Do not get married, have kids, or spend time around women!!!"
If a woman punches herself before lying to the police youre actually better off killing her before she reaches the phone. The first case youre 100% fucked while the second you have a chance to get away with it AND She receives a punishment regardless of whether you do.
And why's that? Your comment strikes me as very integrated feminist TBH. As all fascism movements exclusion is one of their main drives. Care to elaborate?
fucking cunts. that's why tv is dead
"Then, they display the exact opposite of even *those*. Showing the kind of hatred and bigotry they project onto everyone else around them."
"Lack of romance and intimacy is NOT my biggest issue with inceldomIt's **bullying**. It still occurs to me at the age of 21 in medical university. People in general associate bullying with middle school when kids undergo puberty, but it still continues for me... I *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. But bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. *Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly ""eew"", ""hell no"", ""he is ugly"".... For instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an ""eew"" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite. How am I supposed to be confident? How can I become a doctor when I cannot look in people's eyes from bullying? FML. I am clean. I shower twice a day. I shave and have a professional haircut. I use Chanel. I ride a scooter. I care for my skin. I am super kind and friendly. I am fit (BMI 20). I wear expensive clothes."
"Bull fucking shit. What makes you think you're worse than a group of girls? You're not. They're girls. Get that through your head. Women constantly test you no matter who you are. They were probably laughing at something else. Did you look at them funny? Were you extremely unhygenic or what? Dude, psychosis is a real thing that people have that can range from being really mild to very severe. Please, if you're not trolling, go to a fuckin doctor then. Tell somebody."
"Isn't this what they wanted ? To kill ""traditional gender roles"" or it doesn't work like that when they need to move their asses and do actual work ?"
"There aren't many things that are more satisfying than telling a girl, ""No."""
Telling them to hit the treadmill is better [Owned](https://youtu.be/T0xoKiH8JJM?t=164)
It's funny to see the hamster that starts to act up in their little widdle tiny brains after saying that too.
"I'm getting more action as well, but it's dying down as women Simp up The best time to hook up is a day after a holiday tho, for anybody that's interested in a bit of in and out"
"Actually the best day to hook up for a 'hit it and quit it' session is on Valentine's day. Women's ego's are at an all-time low because no sucker is wining and dining them. Especially if their friends are out being wined and dined after bragging about it all week. Therefore, it's the perfect day/time/place to take advantage of desperate women with their self-esteem in the toilet."
"Let them cry ""where have all the good men gone!?"" Fucking dumb whores!"
Their fucking materialistic nature is so hilarious to me. Valentines day is a bullshit commercial holiday with no meaning. But no they NEEEEEED a bf for it and will be sad without. Fuck off haha. Anyone who actually celebrates valentines day is subsaharan IQ
"I'm amazed that they made Mary Elizabeth Winstead look mannish and Margot Robbie look frumpy. I'm sure this had ***nothing*** to do with the lack of male interest in the movie. I wish people would stop confusing female empowerment with lack of femininity or attractiveness. Before/after pictures of women going woke looks like a meth spiral of unattractiveness; Hair, makeup, all conventional beauty standards going out the window - ending up with a shaved head or short, badly styled, rainbow colored haircut."
"So here is the thing. The power of women are closely related to their ability to manipulate men. A woman of high marriage value has social status and is given attention by men, who want to make her happy. This marriage value peaks in her mid twenties. Her social status peaks even earlier. As she gets older her manage value and social status comes less from her potential to make a good partner and more from her accomplishments, one of which should be becoming part of a successful family unit. Having a successful husband and children should add to her status. By 40 her oldest child could be 20. Feminists seek to have power independent of their potential as a partner and of their attractiveness. They want women to occupy a privileged social position *because they are women*! They want to retain that power for longer, at the expense of younger, more attractive women. This is an effort to mitigate the consequences of life choices and to gain power independent of the men in their family. Of course they want media with frumpy, powerful women. Who seem to act a lot like men?"
"Intro Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. Body >Good seduction competently follows Mysterys attraction, comfort, escalation model and so lay reports tend to get repetitious. Im much more interested in the principles of game that you can use repeatedly to get ongoing results than any one particular story. >Knowing the underlying principles means you can get repeat results. Recently I pulled together a threesome with my main girl and a new one I met, and taking RPDs excellent advice I wanted to write this lay report to crystallize for myself what I did right while my thoughts are fresh. I intend to do more of these in the future. There are a number of takeaways >Set the frame from the first time you meet a girl that youre a sexual, non-judgmental guy. Plant the seed with women you date as part of your sexual dirty talk that a threesome would be fun for you and her to enjoy together. >When pitching the actual threesome date to a girl you dont know well, be indirect. Instead just suggest another friend joins for a drink or that you hang out at your place. Give girls plausible deniability. >Threesomes take even stronger leading than a normal 1:1 date. You as the man have to lead the girls through the entire process. Conclusion Threesomes are fun but tricky. How this benefits the community Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. If you are a guy and you want a threesome, then this is a guide to help you make that happen. Most guys have no idea how to make this happen so it's nice to see someone who does. TL;DR. Threesomes are fun but tricky and this includes a bunch of information about how to make them happen."
"His main girl getting turned on is of extreme importance to the success of the threesome, and is therefore highly worth documenting to himself, which is why he wrote the blog in the first place, by his own account. If you had ever navigated a threesome yourself, you would likely understand this, so I'll assume you haven't and explain in a bit further detail. Whether they discussed it beforehand or not (he hints they did), his main girl has veto power (he likes the girl and clearly doesn't want to lose his primary relationship over a random internet stranger); main girl can shut this down at any time whether he likes it or not. Therefore, her happiness, attraction and desire - that is, her being turned on - are the highest priority of making this threesome a reality. Keep cringing at descriptions of expert seduction. More threesomes for me."
"More often than not truth isn't coming out or does way too late. This guy already got social repercussions for something he didn't. The same way Johny Depp was. If a woman says that someone assaulted her, then people would be like ""believe the victim!!"" and just side with her even without any evidence supporting her claims."

"Women don't want anything other than prostitution with extra steps, and all those steps involve hurting the guy."
I'm cool with it. I've never considered women to be more than they are. No delusions. We now get to see them trumpeting their harlotry with pride. At least they aren't hiding it anymore.
"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends. Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man. Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early. Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..) Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!). We divorced 6 months later when she cheated. Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed. Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids. Married the first mom type I found. several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies"".. Divorce cost over 500k. My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand. Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them. Lessons, for you younger brothers? Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real. (Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.) Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts. Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS. Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim"".. The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone.. So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are.. Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER. In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them. Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back. And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks. Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you. Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you. And, be of good cheer. They quarantine you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!"

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are.. Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER. In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them. Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back. And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks. Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you. Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you. And, be of good cheer. They quarantine you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!"
"Great write up. It's great that you've Found a way to rebound from divorce. . That's an experience. I've never had. And don't envy anyone. . My question is in regard to your mention of having 40 year old friendships. I have really struggled to find. Men, that would make good friends. . I had a few guys that I'd known for more than 20 years, but Those relationships fall apart when the females they are involved with pressure them to break contact with friends and family in the predictable way. They are too blue pilled to make their own decisions in this regard. How do you suggest finding red pilled guys to bond with? Have you ever had to wait for the if and when of a former friend coming out of the blue pilled haze? Have you found a way to be friends with blue pilled guys despite the lack of common values and the obstacles females impose on them? I have no trouble spending time by myself But it would be great to have the kind of friendships that I used to. I'm just not sure that is possible. The guys on this sub are the closest I have to real friends."
Women (weak people) have ZERO mercy when they have power...
"The worldwide hive mind is spot fucking on. Women can't ever be happy at the top of their local social hierarchy anymore, now they hear stories of other middle aged women like MacKenzie Bezos and Janet Jackson on down to Becky down the block divorce raping their hubbies around the world, stealing all the cash, and riding off into the sunset on Tyrone's dick to go shopping forever. The divorce industry keeps profiting and families keep disintegrating by selling these bored housewives a false hope of winning the divorce lottery, all it costs them is everything they built and to hell with the collateral damage. Imagine how many families could be saved if the global hivemind competition was curtailed?"

"Im not sure what you mean on the second point. Yes, those women are generally attractive but I think people here have acknowledged factors like race in desirability and noted that blonde blue-eyed Stacies are usually the ones most put on a pedestal."
"No, clearly there's three types of women: mom, porn stars and angry Twitter feminists. And clearly all of those are undateable (except mom maybe?) That's it. Nothing in between."

"Hell, you don't even have to cede that much; does defending women because you think'll they'll fuck you make it *wrong* to defend women? Even when 'soyboy' or 'virtue signaler' was used by PUA communities it didn't make sense. (after all, isn't having sex the whole point of PUAs and undedicated incels?)"

"This is what happens when women sleep with too many men (Don't be this guy)I met this chick while traveling alone, never had any plans to bang her. She was nice to be around with, but I wasn't feeling like doing her. She is 30, purple hair, tattoos, and a decent 100 C\*ck stare, just wanted to travel with someone. She tries to put some moves on me, I'm not into her, so she tells me then she has a BF but things are not going well between them. After she understood we are well into the friend zone, she tells me all about her past (cheating, many partners, threesomes etc) and I'm not surprised. Of course, she says it's all in the past, she is now an adult. Fast-forward 1 month later, she texts that me she and her BF are ""figuring stuff out"" (aka she cucks him). Don't be this guy, ever. In other words, water is wet and the sky is blue."
"Sky can be gray too. >She is 30, purple hair, tattoos That's enough of arguments to make you stay away. Even one-time bang can bring trouble with those chicks - not worthy."
Sometimes in the business world you have to ask a woman over 25 where the guy that actually does stuff is.

Women arent difficult to understand. People in general arent difficult to understand. It is a great trick to make you think this so that you will work harder to get the smallest smile from a woman. Once you understand that women mostly reach only the 3rd stage of moral development and then look at her motivation and upbringing... you can pretty easily understand what shes thinking.
"One thing that helps understanding women- they are always *always* concerned with themselves. Their husband, their parents, even their children always come second to their own interests. Even when it seems they are doing something charitable, it is always for what they get back. I used to work with charities and women loved filling the roles as long as 1) the job was easy and especially 2) they get acknowledged for the job. They will never work anonymously. Ever. That is just how they are wired."
"That's very true. They have zero long range thinking, which is why so many of them spend beyond their means. They can't picture the future at all. The only reason they act concerned about climate change is because it's the trendy thing now. They are followers."
Not just that. Climate change is presented as an immediate consequence. Thats their strength. The moment something appears to be an immediate consequence they will drop other things. So the economy doesnt matter next to climate change because they cant wrap their minds around it. But climate change is expressed simply. The planet will get hot and we will die. It puts urgency on it. Thats why they are concerned about it.
"Women want the traditional gender roles for privileges, but not responsibilities. No women want responsibility. Much less accountability."
"Is it not strange? That among the influx of feminists and simps commenting here, non of them ever, ever comment on these threads. They obviously see them, as they are quick to jump at anything that suits (or rather can be interpreted as suiting their agenda). Surely they are not blind to these observations and even if they were, you would expect them to disagree. No? But they don't. This confirms what we already know; They choose to ignore this. Which can only mean one thing. They are intellectually dishonest (and they know it) which makes them so thoroughly unempathetic that they prove themselves to be sociopaths (legally retarded ones at that)."
">Society encourages women to be sluts. At the same time, a man is told to find that one NAWALT. And if she betrays him, then it's his fault for marrying a hoe. Society frowns upon judging females for their sexual history whatsoever (e.g. *""Her past doesn't matter!""*). And if a male insists on doing so \[due to having standards\], he is promptly accused of **slut shaming**."

"My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues. It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"". This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"". I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion. The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach. TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head."

Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach. TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head."
"Cold approach is very hard. Forget people judging, worry about how the girl feels. Many might not like it or find it weird or creepy. And many will love it and be amazed by your balls to go up to her."
"You are genuinely struggling with how approaching women (your needs and wants) might be at odds with ethical and proper social calibration and empathy. Its normal. But you dont have enough under your belt. Go out and do it. Hopefully you learn and get good at it. Then youll understand that its no big fuckin deal. Woman dont care that much about being approached. They often get approached badly and by creeps, but youre not one of them. Its doesnt bother most liberated woman if a normal guy is attracted to her and tries to start a spark. They arent that fragile. The ones you want are the ones that are emotionally stable, like men and like sex. Its not that big a deal to say hi. Youre blowing it out of proportion: its mostly fun for both you and her. Again, its normal to feel that. You just need desensitization and practice."
"100%. I struggled with the same things. A coworker once told me ""wait, you approach women in the grocery store? Do you realize how obnoxious you're being?"" I didn't approach for a month afterwards. But eventually, it dawned on me. When I approach a woman, I always do so respectfully, to express my desire genuinely, in an authentic search for love and connection. There is **absolutely nothing** wrong with that. In fact, I'm an asshole if I don't approach. She's walking by, looking gorgeous as fuck, and I'm not even going to pay her the compliment of trying to date her? That's extremely rude. Guys who don't approach are assholes. I genuinely believe that."
"Try approaching in locations that aren't so socially unacceptable first (malls, groecry stores, bookstores, concerts, etc...). Street approach is obviously less normal/harder. Open with a light compliment about a unique object of clothing (never compliment her body, eyes, or hair) she's wearing or an indirect situational observation/question. Then cold read some things about her (""you look like a (insert occupation here/______ major)""). If she isn't receptive smile, say ""have a nice day"" and move on. If she isn't showing any sign she wants you to go away, take the convo towards finding a common interest. If you find one, ask for her number to do that interest together. If she says no, say ""take it as a compliment"" and eject. Approach instantly too (3 seconds rule), because lingering or following her around the store to approach is creepy. Also try approaching in different locations as to avoid running into the same girls over and over. And don't go for a hug or anything physical on the approach (but do hold strong eye contact)."

"CBC's been pushing this narrative this year up north too. Granted, they also sacked one of their longest tenured commentators because he made some rather negative generalizations about immigrants not wearing poppies and supporting the Canadian forces by attending Remembrance Day events. Thankfully they've left the game broadcasting to people who (somewhat) know what they are doing and stuck the women on the intermission commentary behind the desk."
"The one thing: To get laid with attractive girls and rest deeply in a state of ""pure awareness""I used to be very state-dependent, always chasing it like if it was a drug Until I realized that the key to be able to successfully connect with anybody at any venue has nothing to do with state Connecting with others and developing intimacy with girls is about getting close within ourselves first Doesnt matter what we do to try to fix ourselves, until we realize our inner sense of completeness well never get there In the past I used to do lots of approaches, different stupid social freedom exercises, I used to learn a bunch of positive mindsets/ frame of reality But none of these things were really sticking on me, it kind of felt like it was a constant chase and once that I would hit that state the next day it was gone lol From there I came to the obvious realization that state is useless Naturals arent state dependent they get laid in all kinds of moods cause they tend to be comfortable and at home with all of the different sensations they feel during a conversation, so why should we be any different? Some of us are putting an insane amount of effort into trying to improve our body language, voice tonality, eye contact, lines and communication skills, frame, etc This takes a lot of mental energy, will keep you stuck in your head and it will keep reinforcing the fact that youre not enough and that you need more The girls and other people will feel this too So what about focusing on that one thing that will naturally help with everything else? In the case, you didnt know the only thing you need to focus on is you But here Im not talking about the mind, most seduction and self-development school focus on upgrading the mind with new programs but Im sure that many of us already felt the limitations of this paradigm(; Here Im talking about that which is beyond the mind, the changeless always present You being in tune with this is true masculinity It may sound like nice philosophy but this is practical my friend, is an inner experience that once embodied will completely change how you communicate and how people react to you Since practicing this connecting with strangers and especially girls as become super easy When I authentically feel like I want to get laid, that same night Ill meet a girl and if the situation will be in our favor well have sex that night otherwise the day after. When we go beyond the game suddenly things become spontaneous, we stop being limited by the paradigm of pick up and seduction and from there, girls start to experience us as more attractive and they genuinely will stick with us also after sex. People, in general, will seek us out, invite to social events, cause now they see in us what they are looking for in them, this is the next level, my friend. Start by giving up the wantingness to attain a certain inner state, realize that you have always been there... There is nothing that you need to add, you are already complete my friend allow yourself to rest in this realization \* ""home""= ever-present sense of inclusiveness, that which never changes, that which is beyond every thoughts and emotion and at the same time includes them next time you meditate or you are infield try to ask yourself the question: ""who is the one having experience of this?"""
What is the point of pretending like you really dont know youre pretty when you get asked out every day and get laid or hookup almost every day/week?Every Stacy I knew had this experience when I was in hs. Im also sick of Beckies and Stacies being allowed in here and on the ask subreddit. Do we really need their humble bragging experiences of being asked out every day and having guys beg to sleep with them?

"seriously. ive seen some stacies say that they used to be a femcel but glowed up, but to be a stacy you already have perfect facial features that you were born with. they were probably never femcel to begin with and cant really relate to our struggles. plus i dont see why they would purposely go on this sub. if by some miracle chance i were able to become a becky id leave this sub and never come back"

"So... Would you girls say that mentalcels are invalid, or at least not supposed to be here? I for example carry scars from my femcel days. Can't function normally and still involontary celibate because of it. I think that when i vent about it here, it is sometimes taken as an insult, or like i'm humblebragging. And a part of me completely understands, although i wish it weren't like that. Because i know if i had had this sub back when i was ugly and bullied, i would have been angry at Beckies and Stacies posting here as well. Most likely. I am just asking a question, not trying to argue with anyone's feelings. I don't want to annoy anyone with my presence. I wonder if a sub for mentalcels would be better? Our struggles are different after all. I personally feel at home here, when i read femcels i see myself years ago, and i relate to the anger (i still have it in me). But i feel that i may ruin the feeling of being in a safe space for some girls. And i don't want that, obviously... I just don't know where else to talk."

"Really bizarre sub. I some times peruse it because some of the more sane posts sometimes have helpful insights into the female experience. On one hand they fucking hate men. It is straight-up sexism that would not stand if the genders were reversed. On the other hand 99% of them seem to not get the irony that they consider themselves a catch, yet they mostly shitpost about getting as much dick in themselves as possible. On the front page right now there is a post ranting about how the OP is taking dick from ""three different low value males"" and how that empowers her while waiting for a ""high value male"". I'm no expert but the sort of guy that they consider the gold standard is either going to be married or smart enough not to pay attention to the kind of people who post on that sub. &#x200B; Like, the mental gymnastics in that sub would win gold at the olympics."

"Happens more often than you would think. Used to work at a bank, woman trust officer (of all things) ripped off little old ladies for $100K. The bank pushed to not have her jailed but made her get a second mortgage to pay them back. She's working two minimum wage jobs to come up with the money to pay it all back. 40-50 y/o women will rob you blind if you're not careful."
That's also prime age for divorce rape
Women can steal money and play real life GTA and get no jail time. Wonder what thats like.
"its the whole pick and choose things women want. * same wages as men, yes. * Going to jail when committing a crime, no, thank you."
"WTF??? What a disgusting bitch! How can we arrest her? She seriously needs to be arrested. What a piece of scum. Also, Issac Butterfield is pretty cool!"
A week after this was originally reported various media have played it up again in ways that are promotional for her. She will actually make money out of it. She wouldn't be the first woman to act in perverted ways towards boys and subsequently profit. It's been quite lucrative for some.
"There is something to your attitude though. If women somehow notice that, and and find out you don't want them, they may start wanting you."
Staying the fuck away from them is better dealing with them at all.

Shes a hoe.

Lol stupid bitch she spreads her legs like nothing and thinks she is something special
They want equality but dont want to touch that provider gender role that is forced on men.
"Girls want sex too, youre the one that messes it up.&#x200B; Its very easy today with the (justified) rise of sexual value/marketplace thinking to get stuck in this frame of thought about women and sex where we assume all hot girls have a shit ton of amazing options (that are better than us). While this may even be true in a lot of cases, Im not sure its a frame that really serves us as men when it comes to approaching new girls and escalating things sexually. You never know where shes at in her desire and life. Some girls are getting ready to go out tonight really hoping they meet a cool good looking guy. They arent ALL bombarded by promoters, bottles, rich guy yacht party offers etc. just because theyre beautiful. So whats the point? The point is that often times girls want to casually date and hookup but we as men fuck it up for them. We do this by projecting all these things onto her life without even meeting the girl. We do this by judging girls and calling them sluts if they sleep around. We create an environment where she cant relax and worries (even more than she already did) about being judged by people and especially you. Lets try a new approach, the frame of curiosity. If youre going to assume something about her assume that shes a little bit lonely and is EXCITED to meet an awesome dude (hopefully you are one and are working on yourself). It may not be the truth, but it will help you approach her with a better vibe and will help you drop some of the negative assumptions that dont serve you at all. Just some thoughts for the day gents! Keep pimping. - Bryce @ theselfreliantman.com"
Yeah it's absurd. We should all be trying to make the world as slutty of a place as possible lol
"Well, I'm not sure if I'm gonna follow you on this one. Your nickname and comment kind of suggest that you're a serial masturbator. :) But jokes aside, I assure you there would be no pleasure if there was no effort/scarcity. And regarding shaming - please believe me on my word, but it most often comes from the females, not from the guys. Guys might say a word or two, but their network is usually very limited. On the other hand, if there are few ""generous"" girlfriends, all of the info travels around in the speed of light."

"Women fantasize about being equal to men, the same way I fantasize about being super sayajin."
"Love this kind of shit. All of the fantasies women love to portray about themselves, really speak about their real life inadequacies. Like captain marvel being the strongest avenger. She's only portrayed that way because in reality, women are weaker than men. Or that black female wakanda scientist in infinity war who was portrayed to be smarter than both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner combined. It was portrayed that way because in reality, men are usually more intelligent than women. One reason we know that women are weak and stupid is because fantasy and comic books portray the opposite."

"The people making these films were notorious throughout history (from the era of the Roman Empire all the way up to the first half of the 20th century) for having strong biological impulses to subvert nature and subvert reality. I haven't seen any of those films because I stopped watching Hollywood years ago, once I realised 90% of films are primarily socially engineering tools and propaganda pieces meant to brainwash. Studies have been done time and time again that show that, in the long-term, the brain is unable to differentiate between what you see visually in real life from what you see visually in film. So if everyone regularly sees smart black women or women who are stronger than men in fictional films, they eventually internalize these as real experiences which is a super effective way of manipulating thought. I'm sure the people producing these films know this. I wouldn't be surprised if they are linked to the same people that funded the aforementioned studies."
"Marvel lost me years ago. I have all the old marvel stuff. But stopped collecting it. They replaced everything i loved about it with stong whamen, just because of strong whamen. I dont need feminist propaganda in my entertainment. Thats not my idea of having a good time. I dont even watch it for free anymore. And i wll never spend another penny on it ever again."

Yep. And that's exactly why you don't see women doing it....
"See this? See this shit? I hate this how this is portrayed by women, trying act smarter than men. Sickening. I used to read great comics and all of them had great plot and story. And almost none of them involved women. I would need to find old comic books that doesnt involved the vast amount of stupidity of women."

I grew up in Canada and here Chads would not try to sleep with ugly girls, not even for easy sex. They could just get a Stacy girlfriend and she would have sex with them.

It was only ugly guys who tried to pump and dump ugly girls because they couldn't always get sex from Stacies so they started to look for ways to find shameful sex."

I swear men can be heartless *obligatory not all. But I would overhear some guys being like damn shes ugly but we banged. Cant be seen with her. Ehhh .
It is so amazing how they cannot are their hypocrisy. I swear every argument Ive had with a crazy ass girlfriend when she was just mad and needed to argue is the feeling I get when I talk to these people.
"So they fight when they see a female getting her vagina burnt. Wow, our penises is literally being ripped off and it's still legal. So much for EQUALITY feminism"
"Feminism was never about equality, it was about superiority"
Cunts. If it was female genital mutilation wed have a task force lol
"Reminds me of a post I saw somewhere where a person was pointing out the fact that a Stacy kept putting herself into photos with her paintings to get more upvotes. I even think it turned out that she didn't even make 'em, just bought 'em and posed."
Solution: team up with a Stacy and make her pose with your art then auction it.
Beauty that Stacy is born with will always be seen as a higher achievement than a talent a femcel has honed and nurtured for years. Suifuel indeed :(
"Oh this definitely does happen. Not a long time ago (like a week ago) there was a Stacy here that posed in pictures with her paintings, and some people started pointing out how the pictures where she was in gained more upvotes as opposed to the posts/pictures that were just her art alone, which raked a very minimal amount in comparison. She then even admitted herself that she did it because it was a way to get her art recognized easier. More power to her for finding a way to exploit the system ~ the system here being a bunch of thirsty Reddit men who are literally the embodiment of the [awooga copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/c7x26q/awooga_awooga/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) when they see an attractive woman. This isn't the first time I've seen it happen, it happens everywhere. On the Instagram and Tik Tok art community it's super prevalent as well, obviously."
"I never understood this part of male psychology, like for me seeing a hot guy in a picture doesnt make me any more or less inclined to upvote/like a picture. What exactly is it about men that makes them more inclined to upvote pics with stacy in them? Like are they just EXTREMELY horny all the time? If so Im ngl I underestimated their horniness like I wouldnt think it would affect stuff like this"
The Crazy Bitch and Bad Boy combination never ends well.
"I hate it too but the only reason why I'm doing it now is so that I have something when I reach that point where I snap and stop doing it anymore. I'd just suggest to every incel that if you have a chance of working on the black market or just doing some unregistered work, do it. If you can exploit the government in any way do that too. If you have parents who'll support you and you can tolerate living with them, do that. Whatever it takes to contribute as little as possible and get the most And if anyone tries to guilt trip you think of housewives and stay at home moms who turned unemployment into the biggest human sacrifice. Why should leeching be reserved only for those in a relationship? Especially when you think that they're usually not even providing their husband with sex to justify it. Comes down to the same thing."
"This is how I like my women, nice and attainable."
"I remember having an existential meltdown once I had life served to me on a silver platter. Multiple girlfriends; I lived to fuck and smoke free weed these hoes were buying me. I was being worshipped like a god. I had never been so miserable in my life. Shattered it all so I can go back home and find my true passion. (Music) Having been fucked out and served all the female validation my little former beta self could ever ask for years, Ive got all the time and fuck all to care about girls. I just want to get educated as a backup plan and preform my own concerts."
Fuck those single-breasted bitches.

"Preface: Yes I know she is 15. Lets not be dishonest and act as if 15 year olds are not already subject to (either the benefits or consequences) of lookism. SO YES. Im going to be talking about a teenage girls looks. I was just thinking right now about how charli dimelio is completely average facially in the sense that she isnt strikingly beautiful. Her face is just non offensive so that makes her good looking in an upper tier normie way. Then I began thinking okay maybe it about her body since she makes dance videos primarily. And again her body is fairly standard for a 15 year old. Shes just thin in that desirable but still achievable way. Everything about her is marginally upper tier normieaside from her technical dance skills which are significantly above averageand yet shes RULING a looks based social medium. This really got me thinking about how once you are just conservatively above average as a white woman most of the worlds doors are open to you. Everything about Charlis look is inoffensive. I always expected her to be some really genetically blessed girl because of all the hype surrounding her. But her moderately above averageness is what has made her palatable to a large audience. Charlis a big reminder to me that lookism really doesnt affect white women. The complaint is always about not having the benefits of the best looking white women. But there are benefits exclusive to being an average looking white woman that, in some cases, I would take over being Stacey. As a black women you can never been palatable to such a large ground of people no matter your looks level. Thats disheartening."

"Superior logic: My body my choice. If the baby has a penis, then is the woman a man? And if she's now a man should she shut the fuck up about what women can do with their body? Hmmm"
A foetus is not your body. It's a separate human being that you are murdering because you don't want morning sickness for 9 months.
Abortion due to medical complications or rape make up less than 1% of abortions. Most women do them for convenience.
Unbelievable this is no different than child sacrifice back in the days when it was practiced by the Spartans.
What a joke here in Greece we have a saying your rights stop where another persons rights start a fetus is a person and womans rights stop when the fetuses/persons rights strat. It's discusting its used the other way around.

This is how today's western societies look likeAn average guy- 24 yo- 0 sexual partners Average woman- 20 yo- 10 sexual partners It's over
Chads are top 20% of population.They are the highest tier of men.Meanwhile women have far more sex at only 13% sexlessness while guys are at 30%.Really makes you wonder huh
They're women on this planet that honestly believe that men can't be sexually harassed or raped.
They're women on this planet that honestly believe that men can't be sexually harassed or raped.
"Unfortunately, the definition of rape started out where men couldnt be the victims. Feminists wanted a broader definition of rape rather than the tighter definition at the time. With the definition change, it allowed men to be the victims, but women still werent able to be perpetrators. The feminists were outraged and wanted it to be changed back."
"3One Approach Every Day Challenge - Day 33-----Day 3----- So today I was at a trampoline park with a friend. We ended up playing dodgeball against two very cute girls. After we played 2 rounds I approached one of them. Me: ""Hey wait a second"" Her: ""Oh hey"" Me: ""Don't worry I don't want to sell you anything, I just think you are very cute. Do you maybe want to grab a coffee sometime?"" Her: ""Oh I'm sorry but I have a bf"" Me: ""Well maybe then a coffee as friends?"" Hey: ""sry I don't think this will be possible"" So basically a flake again but I got her Instagram"
"I agree with you, but I still think what he did was good. It seems as he's in the beginning process of figuring out the ropes. And in that period it's good to find out what can be done and what can't.

Joker doesnt even work with a woman. Besides watching angry feminist eat candy and post fat acceptance stuff on Tumblr will not sell
"It's funny because they'd probably fund it. Even that dumb shit ""Invisible Toxic Masculinity Rapist Man"" movie has already grossed box office to cover its $9 million production cost. I guess they've learned that if you want o be profitable on man hating movies, you have to cut to the bone of expenses. Of course, I'm sure the movie is retarded, and since I'm told it's not a movie for me, I certainly won't pay to see it. I doubt I'll steal it (I would download a car) as I don't give a shit about invisible people."
"I get it. A woman who isn't psycho / bipolar, knows how to cook, is financially responsible, has a clean home / car, is not obsessed with social media, has a steady job, etc. A real science fiction blockbuster!"
That's not woman
"Im with you. Who gives a fuck. What matters is if YOU are interested. Looking for bullshit IOIs is still putting women on a pedestal, waiting for their permission to talk to them. If the lion wants the zebra he doesnt wait for signals to see if its ok to eat them lol"

I agree.... but they dont want a fake chad either. Either way though if you at least look like chad or Tyrone your probably gonna get your dick wet

"To get right-wing moids to give half a f\*ck about your existence, follow these 10 easy steps! &#x200B; 1. Be white, preferably Anglo-Saxon. Nordic or Germanic is also good. 2. Be skinny. Anything over the exact center of the chart for a healthy BMI range is unacceptable. But also have big boobs. 3. Be blonde. 4. Be young. Women over 30 are past it. Women over 35 are useless parasites. 5. Be from a wealthy family. Right-wing politicians don't actually care about working-class whites. 6. Be beautiful. Anything under high-tier Becky is pointless. 7. Be married. Any unmarried woman over 25 is clearly defective or a tradthot. 8. Be a conservative 'Christian'. Love your neighbour, as long as said neighbour is wealthy, healthy, conservative and white. 9. Talk about men's issues constantly. Forget about women who are experiencing poverty, domestic violence, sexual abuse or mental health issues. Men need more attention, since the feminazi's are out to turn their sons gay and make their wives run away with black men. 10. Say the words 'Tradition', 'Illegal immigration, 'Crime' and 'Libtard' at least once every sentence."

"Aye, even here these dolts still see us as possessions. \#walkaway"

"Witnessing Anima/Animus possession within the evolution of divorceAnima and animus are Jungian concepts. The anima is all the subconscious feminine impulses of the masculine mind, while the animus the all the subconscious masculine impulses of the feminine mind. They are best thought of as yin and yang. When ""possession"" happens, it refers to a takeover of the dominating part by the lesser part. Chaos ensues. ____ My friend is married with two very young children. He is a textbook extrovert. He had an active bachelor life, never a problem getting women. He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Since childhood, he has created a number of memes (Dawkins definition, not internet definition) within our friends group that stuck for months. On top of that, he rakes in a comfortable six-figure salary in the finance field. But the curious thing about this man, who I consider a brother, is that he's never wanted to be a leader. The thought turns him off. And he has always gone for women he could be submissive with. ""Alpha in the streets, beta in the sheets,"" doesn't quite describe it. More like beta in the house as soon as he steps through the door. His wife comes from money. Big family, not divorced. She is, for the purpose of this discussion, otherwise a typical woman. A little more neurotic than most, but typical nonetheless. She took a high turnover job that she was doing when they met. She stopped doing that job because it was ""stressful"" (and really it is, but c'mon, could you imagine quitting), and stayed home to take care of the kids. But her quitting predates the pregnancy. ____ Lat year my friend had a tragedy in his family, the kind that will weaken any man. Most women will allow you to be weak for 1, maybe 2 days. But in him this persisted. And eventually he displayed the **ultimate form of weakness**: he considered suicide. Even worse, he told her. So she did what women do and dragged him to a couples therapist where most of the time was spent with her berating and ""venting"" about him. And, he tells me, they would always come back from therapy seemingly worse than when they began. This is a stereotype that I think we've heard about a lot. I was very disheartened to see it play out so clearly, so close to home. And I'm not even kidding, you could have scripted it. Really saddening stuff. So of course she did what any woman does when she sees her man hit rock bottom for a prolonged period of time. She supported him throughout in a very nurturing way and built him back up. Ha. Come on. No, she kicked him out. He is now simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. ___ So what I'm seeing is possession on both sides. She is the one making all the decisions and she has simply switched off to him. There is no getting through to her. She has somehow turned his thoughts of self harm against him and made it about her. You know what I'm talking about. When a girl gets to that point, becomes that brick wall. She becomes a stranger. It's a terrifying thing to go through if you've never seen it before. That's her animus possession. And he, he is reduced to begging. He wants to ""fight"" for her. He is purely following his emotions. He is talking too much. He is a shadow of who he was, taking a one-two punch of his family tragedy early, and now this new tragedy. His anima is in charge. ___ Underlying this is a jarring reality: I have looked up to this man my whole life. I have mimicked and copied some of the things he does as an example, with some really good success. This is a guy who has made the right moves since day 1. While I was fucking around with my head in the clouds, making mistake after mistake, he always -almost naturally- knew the right thing to do. Now I am worried about him. I am worried about losing my brother. And he has already been seeing therapists all year, both on his own and the couple. I think I might be the only one on his side, because I know that despite all his genius he has never been here before and doesn't know what to do. And that's why he is making the wrong moves. If I didn't now what I know, my reaction would also be to distance myself because no one likes a downer. But I know everyone else is doing that. After the shoe does drop, I'm going to try to guide him correctly. But I've only ever rescued myself from the anima before. It took months, almost a year. I just need him to not fucking kill himself."

"Yeah as a woman if you don't look like a submissive prey, men won't like you..."
"Yup, if a man, any man (even the nicest looking old man) helps you out without you asking for it, it's because he finds you at least somewhat pretty. I mean, considering you were a femcel, i'm sure you know it as much as i do. When they find you ugly they never ever offer any help. They don't see you. Now, it doesn't mean that they automatically want to fuck you. Some of them don't even have a working dick anymore yet they still only see the pretty girls and don't care about the rest. They just like seeing and grabbing the attention of pretty women. Nobody wants to grab the attention of an ugly girl. Congrats on ascending, keep up with your efforts but stay woke. Don't fall for men's bullshit."

This video must be fake. If current media has taught us anything it is that women never lie about such things for selfish or vindictive reasons. We must always believe ALL women under any circumstances. This has to be some of that new deep fake technology. That man is a sinister and perverted predator. No other conclusion makes sense.
Why anyone believes anything a females ever says is beyond me.

Ikr? Stacies are kinda annoying.
That does not necessarily make it not true just because a Stacy said it this could be a circumstantial fallacy on your part.
"Don't underestimate the cluelessness of a stacy. She would say you aren't getting that attention because you aren't posting photos or posing well or picking the right outfit or editing well. And through her eyes that phrase is true, even if she benefits from being the beauty standard."

"This kinda reminds me of a girl i dated. It wasnt that she thought i was upper class because i was not. It was that she complained about almost every meal when we went anywhere and complained about the staff excessively. Like they were not people with feelings. She was spoiled me as a kid we ate out 2x a year she went to all the best places in town. Ill say it she was a flat out bitch to wait staff. ""Well their not doing their job""! Would end up complaining so much they would comp the whole tab half the time. She was just showing me how little she valued me taking her out. Im trying to enjoy myself not listen to complaining about the temp of a plate or you had a empty drink for 7 min. Now she is going to die alone with a cat and feminism like she wanted."

"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression. Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags. Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay.

Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary. **Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process.

Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone.

Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you?

Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay. A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression. Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags. Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary. **Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males.

"""It's hard for us to look big"" Because you're not BIG. If you're stuck at home, pick up the heaviest thing you own and move it around until you can't anymore. For me, this is my ~~asian sex slave~~ desk, so I did some lifting exercises and decided that if I break ~~her~~ it, then it was worth it for my continued physical excellence in these trying times. En serio, if you can't take GLO's advice re: group workouts, at least go buy some dumbbells. 30 pounders will do fine and you can go high-rep for the next few weeks, depending on your own personal ratio of soy to boy."
"I'll be honest, sometimes I feel bad AMOG'ing these dopes. But when I just taught your cute, skinny skank of a girlfriend a yoga class, and she can't stop staring at me during class, and makes a point of walking across the studio to stare directly into my eyes and thank me and keeps staring and smiling while she's turning away to leave, while you're standing there rolling up her gear for her like a good little boy, honestly dude, you don't exist to her \*or\* me at that point. I'm going to do what real men do. True story from the other day bro. In other words, if ""your"" girl is giving me signals, your being a pussy is not my problem. She's not yours. It's just my turn."

">1)In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals I agree. There's one other category I would add to this, the ""feel good"" posts that are generally written in a poetic, metaphoric style without conveying any useful information besides the ""you should feel awesome and great"" vibe that so many generic, often liberal, self-help writers tended to write after PUA got into mainstream and they had to sell their stuff with sleazy tactics like appealing to the emotions and storytelling - instead of letting the work defend itself. Few recent examples I could name is The next generation, Demonstrating unique value, Animus possesion, The case against PUA and Dich cold approach posts. >2)They want the male who has what others don't That's not true at all. They want the male who other women want. For example women don't want the one eyed midget with hunchback, they want the rockstar which other women want. Being unique is NOT equivalent to being an alpha. >3) and can thus disrupt the status quo No woman wants a man who disrupts status quo. As demonstrated by 3,5 billion women living today, they all want the rockstar, the famous actor, the famous athlete and so on - regardless of the woman's culture or economic background the same principles apply. Disrupting the status quo is not enough, you also need to become ""famous for disrupting status quo"". Otherwise the ""status quo disruptor"" without the ""famous"" part is just a party pooper no woman wants to associate herself with b/c he lowers her status. >4) Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation > you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males That's not true at all. Here you're advocating for not hitting the gym and not lifting b/c it imitates the strategy of an athletic men that are successful with women thanks to being athletic. Imitating what other men did is not the endgame, it's a tool. You look at what the best sprinters in the world did before you, you analyse their training patterns, their workouts, diet etc and then you create your own, tailored to your own needs. If you want to learn how to write complicated intellectual posts you read complicated intellectual books. By reading enough of them and by understanding how and why authors wrote what they wrote you begin to develop your own understanding and by writing you develop your own style. Neither the understanding nor the style would be possible without the authors before you b/c you looked at what they wrote, adopted what you liked and added your own unique style to it. IOW, do get creative but don't waste time reinventing the wheel. >5) When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? Never if you don't have to. If you want to proactively AMOG some other dude it's only b/c he has higher social value than you and you want to take him down or the dude is threat to you (meaning he's there to steal your girls). There is absolutely no need to AMOG if you're the alpha of the set, if you're the most attractive or the most desired. AMOGing for the sake of AMOGing (getting verbally or physically aggressive toward everyone all the time) is not attractive b/c it demonstrates lack of social intelligence and communicates you're an antisocial sperg. AMOGisn should be a tool not your personality. >6) No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was the boss of the people who called him an asshole. IOW he paid them to do what he told them to do, however he told them is irrelevant b/c he's the boss and he's paying. The situation is different if you're not the boss, for example you are looking to get some capital from a venture or angel. Try being an asshole to VC and see how it works out. If you have the power you can behave like an asshole and be famous for it, be forgiven for it sometimes even liked for it. If you don't have the power, you're just an asshole. > 7)A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Nobody on TRP belives in that. This was true in 2005-ish PUA days and got corrected on TRP a long time ago. >8) Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. This is not true. An alpha BECOMES an alpha when he ""defeats"" his competition. By definition her orbiters (men she's won't fuck) are not your competition, the other men she's fucking are. Since she already knows they are beta, you're not competing with them you're mentally masturbating about how cool you are and how the orbiters are not. This is pointless behaviour reminiscent of incels hating on guys who fuck. If you want to meat your real competition do this (joke/no joke): next time a plate sends you ""i wanna fuck"" text, respond with ""dont have time"". Then stalk her and see who she's fucking besides you. 9/10 is some scrub badboy/bordeline junkie who is just chill as fuck and has good vibe women enjoy. And that's b/c while working on your looks is important part of the sexual strategy, it's not the only one that matters. For more in depth explanation read Rollo's The Rational Male."
"Ok some comments: 1. Once he found that she went vacationing to his friend home and lied about it, it's over. Done, kaput. Maybe a single good-bye email and that's it. It's irrecoverable. 2. He tries to speak with her and ""she's not her, she doesn't sound like that."" Implying it's his friend writing. No, It's horrible and confusing, but that's her. It's the lightswitch effect. Once they break up with you, they become strangers, completely another person. 3. She then accuses him of being obsessive, dangerous, to blow her phone and the offers to stay friends. This is a typical break-up response, they are all so similar that I think girls must study this shit in school. This is a response of you trying to text and communicate to her. You are dead to her at this stage, she finds weird that dead people try to talk to her. So she's not even angry, she think it's spooky. She doesn't know who you are, literally. That's the lightswitch effect. It's over, let it go. 4. After some time, the bitch has the nerve to try to get back with him? he has to be loaded or something like that. And his friend too? wtf, that's weird."
"nah bro that long text could've been the dude (his ex best friend)... &#x200B; that ho and his ex best friend laying in bed together ho ""oh my god he won't stop blowing up my phone"" best friend ""haha yep that sounds about right"" ho ""how do i stop it should i just block him haha"" best friend ""just give it here, i know what to say"" &#x200B; source: i'm the best friend"
"The hampstering on her part is amazing. How they're able to square a circle in their heads and even after fucking someone over in the worst way, gaslighting them...they still tip up later in like nothing has happened and it doesn't matter. Women are incapable of any sort of loyalty or decency."
The female POV shot would be a reddish monochrome like a CyberDyne Systems 800 Series Terminator . . . Loyalty.exe>>> System error>>> File not found>>> Reboot? Y/N
"I can't watch all of this through, but I skimmed it and the last point at which he should have just broken all contact and moved on was once he had confirmation of her flight. **The.LAST.point.** There were red flags before that. But he should have hard nexted both of them at that point and moved on. **If you are in a live-in situation - don't be - but if you are, and she moves out? It's basically over, except for the denouement.** The ""friend"" is NOT a friend. *""It's nothing sexual.""* Bullshit. His penis is ""friends"" with her vagina. This guy is WAAAAAAY too invested in keeping her, and SIMPing her onto a pedestal. Are they Mormons? I see SLC, and Mormons really push the ""Disney"" on themselves. Evidently this is a year after the events, and this dude is WAAAAAAY too stuck on this situation. This is what the Blue Pill does to you. These two shitheads are living in his head, rent-free. **Lessons He Should Have (But Did Not) Learn:** She's not yours, it's just your turn. Once it's over, drop her and move on. Also, if he was maintaining sexual relationships with multiple women, none of this would be a problem."
"[Cringe inducing](https://youtu.be/XbL2gTjAM50?t=3278), and here I thought this was just a meme. There are some interesting pointers in this excessive video. The girl did not like to be sexual with him, and maybe initially she started the relationship where in there being some attraction. However the hard working beta killed it off with excess prejudice. You can also tell by his rambling at the end he has very little experience with women and that it doesn't seem he's internalized much, even though he knows of Rollo's work. TDLR, beta stereotype gets cheated on, fails to internalize much of anything but some sort of unconscious realization that women are likely viewing him as nothing more than a cash machine."
"In the beginning was thinking, nah, this dude is really telling only a part of the history, the sad music, the bullshit about the dogs crying, I thought he was showing himself intentionally naive and victimized to win sympathies. But the part when he asked her if she had sexual relations with the other dude was so beta, that shit can't be faked, wtf. Others have already remarked his mistakes, but for someone so lonely and naive to man up and don't give seconds opportunities takes nuts, many blue pills would have fallen into the trap of forgiving or feeling guilty (he was guilty of putting her on a pedestal and being very naive, yes, but everything else is the fault of Hoe and Chad)."
"I've been following this guy for quite sometime, he mostly talks about self reliance and not to depend on employment or romanticise it, basically like the red pill when it comes to dev jobs and job hunting. This isn't the first time something like this has happened to him, he is divorced (he got married at 20, he moved all the way to Finland for pussy). He's too hang up on her. He mentions in the video he is reading a Rollo book and talking in TRP lingo so I hope he gets better and doesn't repeat the cycle."
"Stacies are everywhereI leave the house and anywhere I look, I see pretty girls. Is2g they are everywhere, Idk how they got so lucky and I am one of the rare uggos looking like . Germany is full of Stacies. Then I am like yeah understandable no one would be interested in me."
"I recently moved to the US and I thought I had it bad in *my* home country, this place is overflowing with Stacies!! There's a lot of Chads too."
I know that the US is full of hot people. People say Stacies and Chads are rare but I can definetely say uggos are rare in my country. Most ppl are average or above average.
"Eastern neighbour speaking here. Our women are mostly Stacies too. It's a bit irksome when all the body-positive media you see present Western/Anglo-Saxon standards and you're told someone for sure will find you attractive. I don't see body-neutrality advancing catching traction as quickly as I hoped it would. Our feminists also seem to recognise only the sexist aspect of lookism. Maybe I'm too quiet, I don't know..."
"My ""Don't travel here because all those Stacy's in one place is too much suifuel for my pathetic brain to handle"" list: Sweden Russia Colombia Brazil And the latest addition: Germany Any other suggestions, fellow femcels?"
Tel Aviv? Is Germany // Sweden really full of Stacies? Feel like the women care less about their appearance
"Tel Aviv added to my list :( OP said Germany is full of Stacy's, and someone I know who have been to Sweden says it is a paradise of gorgeous women."
"From Brazil, youd considere me a Stacy, I considere myself different in comparing to my peers. Theres a lot of beautiful women here but I think people from white countries will think differently."
By the law if a woman makes an allegation towards him bc wahmen are kweens and they are never wrong and they never lie!
It's mindblowing that everyone gets more offended when you tell some fat chick to start exercising and stop eating junk food.
"I think women just get more sympathy because guys would do anything to get laid and that includes feeling sorry for them. No one will stand behind a short guy or whatever he has that makes him unattractive because no one cares and people (mostly women) would rather make fun of him. Honestly, women should be up in arms at the beauty industry for selling makeup and telling women they can enhance their beauty aka telling women they are ugly. No one bats an eye because putting makeup requires little work/effort so anyone can do it to look ""beautiful"", but working out, dieting, and being healthy is apparently too hard for most women to handle so they complain about it like children. I give women who are fit and healthy mad props."

"Problem is women have most men's favorite treat, pussy. I moved to Latin America and it's easily available so I'm not controlled by it as much as a lonely man in a house in the suburbs of America. I'm not marrying these hoes, just pumping them. I rent once a week,"

"The three layered pyramid. The miniscule tip is made out of men, then the much larger middle part is women, then the overwhelming majority at the bottom is once again men. Women are only competing with each other over that small amount of top tier men."
"Dude got killed twice, no wonder they only gave him five years. Cut the pussy some slack."
Not if you are a woman it seems. Sad.
"please stop valuing the opinion of men you see onlinethis is not a typical ""feel good"" post. this is a reminder. **TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.** if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value. men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that. but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

"I've found that men in real life are that shallow, but they are not that mean. I have many ugly male friends who date a lot and it's obvious that they chase pretty girls. They'll say things in passing like ""oh a new girl arrived at work who's pretty and single which is rare"". This is coming from an obese dude with a beard and I'm thinking ""why does he want pretty girls"", but AT LEAST he's not mean and he doesn't hate women like men online do. He doesn't think that women are ""dating Chads"" and stuff like that. But then again ugly guys easily trick girls into sleeping with them where I live and there's enough pretty girls to go around so maybe that's why they haven't gone full inkel yet."
"I've noticed this with gamers. Male games who go outside love to talk about their favourite games, dont focus on what they hate and love to encourage people, no matter what gender, to play their fave games. Like the average person with a favourite tv show. Guys who speak about games online are just miserable mfers. On the flip side, I've come across far more women virtue signalling ugly men online than I have in reality. A self pitying male irl doesn't really get more than an ""awww, I'm sure you'll find someone."" A self pitying male on Reddit will get ""awww no hun I find 3ft 700lbs guys super sexy. Sexier than Zac efron!!!!1"" Online gives room for people voice their true opinion but theres also bias towards the opinions of those who spend more time talking to strangers than they do socialising with friends. But I wouldn't bother going to shortcels and mgtow for opinions. They're only interested in Stacies. I dont want to look back on my life and say ""wow, I actually convinced a shortcel that I was ugly and unwanted :') "" . We should have higher standards for our mental health. They can screencap and shit their pants all day long for all I care.

"I'd like to point out that what you're describing is not game ""not working"", it's you not even trying it. And why? Because you're ""afraid"". Stop being such a pussy, Jeeze."
"I game but not with hot womenI have noticed that I dont really take advantage of opportunities to speak with attractive women. I talk to women a lot and have sex, but usually only 7s and below. Any advice on how to get out of my comfort zone and get comfortable talking to beautiful high quality women? I went through a pretty rough early adolescence and had this fear drilled into me. Now I am fairly attractive when I take care of myself (last few weeks havent been great, but nobody is out gaming anyways), but I still havent grown out of feeling like an awkward teenager around hot people."
In response to being asked how come guys with high body counts dont want relationships with girls with high body counts?
The Case to Bring Back Dowries
Still wouldn't be worth it for any sane man. Even if they pay us.
"Which is sensible. Woman, as caregivers have typically looked after their parents when they are older, the parents now need to source anyher form of care.as tje daughter (their asset) is taken from them, this is recompense for that. If they have a son typically he would bring a wife into the household to fulfill that role (daughters leave the household, sons stay and marry, bringing a replacement ""daughter"" in) it all works until you try and overlay current western ideology over the top."
"Anthropologists have many theories as to why some cultures have dowry, while others have a bride price. It's thought by some as dependent on the society's tilt in favor of either labor or capital. A man is the king of capital, as he controls assets and inherits property. And when shit hits the fan, he is responsible for defending his treasures. Societies develop private property and form armies because there is strength in numbers. A woman is the queen of labor, as she does most of the household chores and takes care of children/elderly. She also has the obvious capability of birthing more workers, limited only by time and resources and her health."
"Facetime? Are you kidding me?I left this sub for some time cause of seeing excessive amounts of useless advice. I came back recently to see if people are actually still hooking up through dating apps / how they are doing so, but I keep seeing posts on ""How to do a Facetime call?"" or ""How to talk to a girl over text?"" or ""Why aren't girls answering my texts?"" Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how much of a waste of time that is? Do you know you're being used? Girls thrive on attention and you're giving them that, especially at a time like this. Seriously, stop it. I see some people claiming they've already made ""5-6 dates possible for after the quarantine."" Yeah, right cause the first person a girl wants to see after a quarantine is a random fucking stranger they ""met"" on a dating app, Jesus Christ. There's no guarantee you'll meet a girl after the quarantine is over and the quarantine isn't gonna be over anytime soon. You're being delusional and naive. There's no treatment for COVID-19 and there won't be a vaccine for another 12-18 months and yet we're acting like the situation right now is a temporary one, it's not. Get used to it. Either you're making actual moves and meeting people (obviously not in a crowded area), and accept youre taking a risk, or you're not. If you choose not to, then enjoy texting and Facetiming for the next few months-year and watch it take you nowhere. Wake up. Please. Edit: Don't be in denial. Normal life won't resume anytime soon. Please read this: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-government-18-month-plan-life-return-normal/story?id=70046439"
"So you think we shouldn't socialise because you think the quarantine is in any way related to a vaccine and it won't be lifted until there is no vaccine? What should we do then? Talk to our hands after a good jerk-off or something? Send pigeons because facetime is too cringey for you? Be serious, dude, everyone needs attention now, not only girls. Humans are social animals. Hermits exist only in legends. Can't I talk to someone when I'm bored because you think it's ridiculous? There is never a quarantee someone will live up to their word and meet you. And again, this shit won't last as long as you think. 18 months? Dude, read something else than conspiracy theories. By the end of June I will be enjoying an ice cold beer at my favourite bar. That's sure. And if those chicks don't show up, I still have their nudes. Frustration is understandable in such a situation, but you should see a psychologist. You can use facetime for that, too."
These thirsty tards think that COVID was going to improve their chances when really they are ruining any good this isolation would do. Women now get validation for the most mundane public task because Tommy Thirst cant wait to flex his game and show his at home workout gains to the first 300lb pig he sees. Disgusting behavior.
"Part of me feels bad for these women as its just in their nature to fuck up their chances with men later on. They simply cant help it. Maybe there are a select few who dont completely fuck up their chances and keep a low count & find a decent guy to marry but the majority cant help but jump on the CC during their prime years and waste their chance at something real. Even then, women still come with a whole host of issues that are just impossible to tolerate. Its just the way their brains are wired. Im so grateful to be a man"
"I found a girl with an EXTREME scarcity mindset. Is this a good or bad thing?Shes very traditional in her values. Like shes 22 and she will do ANYTHING for me, partly, because shes afraid shell never meet someone else as good as me. Is this a good or bad thing? Edit: Didnt expect the comments. Heres some feedback to clear up the situation. Im mostly asking for perspectives, not advice. 1) at first I didnt even know that the fuck a unicorn was... I had to look it up. No I dont think shes that and I dont think shes perfect. its a stretch for you to assume I did. 2) Weve been fucking for almost a year, no real intentions on LTR or marriage (some guy mentioned me pushing for marriage?). Thats a dumbass assumption and I dont know why you guys think Im trying to LTR her. 3) Yes she is BPD confirmed. For those of you who are scared shitless of BPD women, Ive maximized my benefits from out relationship. You guys just need to know how to control BPD women and dont be so fucking emotionally manipulated 4)"
Of course it's good wtf are you smoking But she must be low SMV if she's scarcity? I mean even some landwhales have orbiters and big egos Or maybe you're better than all her other options Either way all hoes are hypergamous so don't get too comfortable and stay on game always

Sounds like bullshit. Women are programmed to know they can get more. Thats why once you start hitting on a 4-5 she turns into the biggest slut because you made her realize someone wants to fuck her so others will want to as well. Shes is playing you for a sucker

"Why don't I see much talk about the Johnny Depp/ Amber Heard situation?Video commentary on Depp/Heard recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOP9nmzKDww [DISCLAIMER: this video has a comedic slant to it and does not exclusively employ serious or politically correct language] I'd love to discuss this situation because I don't see it being talked about enough. I really would like to hear from feminists on this issue, especially how it relates to: Greater feminist discourse, #Metoo as well as things like how it relates other hashtag movements such as #believe all women, etc. In my opinion this situation flies in the face of all of that and proves a major point made by the MHRM: That women when they want to victimize men can simply falsify accusations and society by large *will* #believe all women. To quote Karen Straughn ""It's not that every woman will, but that any woman can."
"WHAT WOMEN WANT>""After 30 years of studying female psychology, I still haven't found an answer to the big question: What exactly do they want?"" - Sigmund Freud &#x200B; The more a woman corresponds to today's beauty criteria, the more she will turn to the man I will present in this writing. The requirements obviously vary according to their possibilities (physical, age, intellect), their education, background, personal experience. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies. &#x200B; **DEEP DESIRE** During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will : &#x200B; \- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male \- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male \- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male... \- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it. \- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire) \- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual \- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle &#x200B; Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL PARTNER** Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one. &#x200B; Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL COUPLE** The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness). &#x200B; Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father). &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable). &#x200B; **A BEAUTIFUL BOY** Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile. &#x200B; Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive. &#x200B; **FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING** By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases: &#x200B; \- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all. \- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue. &#x200B; **THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...** Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off. &#x200B; The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward. &#x200B; **INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY** Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing. &#x200B; The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe. &#x200B; **MASCULINITY** [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship. &#x200B; Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls. &#x200B; **YOU SHOULD KNOW** One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination. &#x200B; Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too). &#x200B; **STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION** Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous). &#x200B; If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested. &#x200B; **Be handsome, be male.**"
"WHAT WOMEN WANT>""After 30 years of studying female psychology, I still haven't found an answer to the big question: What exactly do they want?"" - Sigmund Freud &#x200B; The more a woman corresponds to today's beauty criteria, the more she will turn to the man I will present in this writing. The requirements obviously vary according to their possibilities (physical, age, intellect), their education, background, personal experience. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies. &#x200B; **DEEP DESIRE** During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will : &#x200B; \- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male \- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male \- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male... \- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it. \- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire) \- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual \- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle &#x200B; Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL PARTNER** Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one. &#x200B; Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL COUPLE** The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness). &#x200B; Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father). &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable). &#x200B; **A BEAUTIFUL BOY** Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile. &#x200B; Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive. &#x200B; **FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING** By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases: &#x200B; \- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all. \- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue. &#x200B; **THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...** Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off. &#x200B; The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward. &#x200B; **INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY** Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing. &#x200B; The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe. &#x200B; **MASCULINITY** [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship. &#x200B; Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls. &#x200B; **YOU SHOULD KNOW** One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination. &#x200B; Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237).

The requirements obviously vary according to their possibilities (physical, age, intellect), their education, background, personal experience. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies. &#x200B; **DEEP DESIRE** During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will : &#x200B; \- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male \- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male \- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male... \- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it. \- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire) \- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual \- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle &#x200B; Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL PARTNER** Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one. &#x200B; Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore. &#x200B; **THE IDEAL COUPLE** The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness). &#x200B; Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father). &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable). &#x200B; **A BEAUTIFUL BOY** Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile. &#x200B; Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive. &#x200B; **FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING** By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases: &#x200B; \- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all. \- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue. &#x200B; **THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...** Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off. &#x200B; The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak. &#x200B; # WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward. &#x200B; **INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY** Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing. &#x200B; The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe. &#x200B; **MASCULINITY** [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship. &#x200B; Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls. &#x200B; **YOU SHOULD KNOW** One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination. &#x200B; Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too). &#x200B; **STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION** Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous). &#x200B; If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested. &#x200B; **Be handsome, be male.**"

"Good post. Touches on a point I don't think is made enough - men also have a dualistic mating strategy, and the times I've been most satisfied with my sex life were when I had both a madonna and whore in my roster. Although would say its pretty damn near impossible to find them in the same woman these days. Finding girls who are LTR material these days is damn hard enough (<5% of girls I've fucked were anywhere even close), and with feminism now if a girl is a freak in the sheets she also gonna be a freak in the streets too lol"

Women don't have too because of feminism, but if you as a guy say your double standards out loud, then the *lol tee hee* women will lose their um ....... scrunchies"
">They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. This is very true. I left academia after my PhD, and that was in hard sciences. But I could see how people are holding onto research themes that make no sense, just because they get funding for it. If they were funded by private corporations, they would long have been gone. The word kafkaesque you used is spot on. What has been human's strength since the dawn of ages is the collaboration between more pragmatic, ambitious, cold-blooded, rational man and the more intuitive, maternal, empathic, emotional and less rational woman. Each trait on each gender can be seen as positive or negative, but they each contribute to a certain balance. Starting to say that not just knowledge, but in fact the whole rational scientific method are 'oppressive', is one of the most self-destructive ideas that our society could have. Sure - we can't measure everything and see things black/white all the time (as men tend to), but we can't rule a society on hunches and beliefs either (as women tend to)."

"It is usually highly correlated with genes. Women prefer mates with better genes, and people with better genes earn more. They found in a Swedish study that women prefer richer men, except those who had won their wealth in lottery. Same also applies to the health richer people are healthier, except those who had won their wealth in lottery."
"That's not really gender specific though. I think most men want to settle down with the best woman they can too. In monogamous societies there is less room for different marital behaviors between sexes because nobody can have more than one spouse. I think the thing that comes closest to ""hypergamy"" is human societies with polygamy, where a woman may prefer to be a wealthy man's fourth wife over a poor man's first wife. Or in premarital sex culture, where a woman on tinder may prefer to be a player's hundredth lay than a virgin's first lay. Those are the main places where obvious gender asymmetries show up."

"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers. Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally. Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying. If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection. Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always. Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs. Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office. What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes. Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants. Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing. Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you. Keep Prizing yourself.

"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers. Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally. Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying. If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection. Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always. Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs. Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office. What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes. Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants. Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing. Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you. Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away. A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat. Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch.

"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers. Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally. Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying. If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection. Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always. Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs. Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office. What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes. Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants. Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing. Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you. Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away. A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat. Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future. Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works. Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck. Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex. I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke. You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future. If you aint gaming, you aint fucking. Be safe. MTC"
This is so true. Sleeping with married women is like shooting fish in a barrel because husbands neglect their wife and stop acting like a leader. They get fat and get stuck in an unsuccessful rut and are no longer exciting. Women get bored and start going to the gym or running or getting hot mom bodies. Ive been with 3 married women over the last 10 years and all of them had this in common - a loser husband. First step - stop being so fucking fat. Theres no excuse for it. Just stop eating if you have to geezus.

"Why can't men talk about women's bodies?From Lizzo's [rant](https://www.bet.com/style/living/2020/02/16/lizzo-calls-out-men-who-judge-womens-bodies.html) to articles like [this](https://madamenoire.com/1130498/why-men-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-comment-on-womens-bodies/), this sentiment has been echoed a lot lately. I'm not sure why or how they are expecting straight men to stop talking about what they find attractive in the opposite sex. Women are quite unapologetic about their preferences and will often let you know about their minimum height requirements ( which tend to be stricter and less flexible than men's preferences). how they like men with facial hair ( 1/4 men can't grow a beard ), their ideal penis size, etc.. Anyone who has been on dating apps knows how "" in your face "" women can be when [talking about a man's physique](https://i.redd.it/rsqzruu8axk21.jpg). Men's feelings aren't really taken into consideration here. You're just supposed to come to terms with your physical image and draw your self-esteem from somewhere else. Men, on the other hand, are expected to play by a different set of rules. You have to bite your tongue when talking about your ideal weight or any other feature that you find attractive. Anything you say can be interpreted as "" putting pressure on women"" or "" perpetuating an unrealistic standard of beauty "". Why is there a need to coddle women and protect them from how men view them? where is that same concern for men who drew the short straw in the looks department? Isn't the subtext a bit sexist? like men should be able to handle it but women can't?"
"There's a lot of layers to it to hate. I think what irritates me the most is the inferred superiority in it. There are circumstances where I can imagine the word 'slut' being used either between consenting adults into dirty talk, or even as a self-identifier used with pride. I can't imagine 'thot' being used in any such way, because its always about that girl over there whose a whore. I find something deeply offensive in the idea that you're better than a woman, because she's had sex, or more likely, feels any sort of ownership in her own sexuality. This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude. There's a distinct component to toxic masculinity that is the idea that a man is inherently superior to a woman, and should have the pick of the litter for some idiot ideal of pure virgin waifu who's never so much as conceived of a dick and is outright terrified of masculine power. Thot is an extension of this, a declaration of being above a woman who simply isn't some submissive, terrified maiden. Also I just think it sounds stupid if you say it out loud."

"Your body count is quite low. The truth, it's about your physical attractiveness. Guys that seemingly do not have issues with getting women do not need to study seduction or any strategy, why is that? It's because there are a lot of women who enjoy what they are looking at, just like you enjoy what you are looking at when you date someone. I don't know why it is that men think just because you have a good job, average in physical appearance and understand some strategy that they should be able to hook up with a woman. It doesn't work like this.. Would you date a women who was a 2 in looks but had a great job? Why would a woman want to do that then?... You likely have adequate exposure already, it's just that women don't seem to be drawn to you. No psychological strategy is going to work here. If you can humbly admit, that you are probably not the dream guy she has in mind when she thinks of being approached by a male, then you have a shot here. You know what women want. The want a good looking guy. Do whatever you need to do to be a good looking guy. Women can put up with a shitty personality, but they will not put up with a an 'okay' looking dude... She only does this when she needs stability and has less options, by then, you have a woman who has goals for the relationship. The I need kids trap and the husband trap."
"Why it's not ""morally"" wrong or hypocritical to sleep with many women yet expect the mother of your kids to not have slept with many menFirst things first, the red pill is amoral, so of course if you don't struggle with this issue then ignore this post. For people like myself who need to have an ethical explanation for what they do, here's why it is fair/not a double standard. Men and women live different lives and are born with unique gifts and potentials, some overlapping, some not. Despite knowing this and capitalizing on their feminine power, many women (and their clueless simp supporters) will still try to shame men for being very choosy with their wives/common law partners/ mother of their children. A man building himself to his ideal man, creating an expanding frame and acquiring intellectual and physical resources will arouse and attract women as he gains momentum. Women may be ""attracted"" to the outward results of his success, but we all know they are ""aroused"" by his upward energy, his alphaness, his mission. Any woman who seduces him on that journey upward is temporarily stopping him. She has grabbed his attention temporarily, and when he busts a nut, he is satisfied where he is. Weak men stay here but an alpha man hops back on the horse and keeps moving upward. He has only been temporarily stopped. When this man has spent many many years building himself, he may decide he is ready for a kid. This means he is very satisfied with where he is such that he is willing to now sacrifice mental physical and emotional energy into the next generation. He is literally sacrificing himself, his upward progress and his current wealth for this woman and child. This woman is getting a lot from this man- loyalty, tons of investment, and he is giving up a lot of other women who would love to be part of his now really established frame. All he is asking back from this woman, is that she be worth giving all that up for. What makes her worth giving that up for? Certainty, or as close to it as he can come, that she will stay loyal to his frame. If she has a history of promiscuity, this means she is very willing to jump from frame to frame, giving herself to men in quick succession. Why would I commit to a woman for 18+ years if she can't stick to one frame? For a promiscuous man, the reverse isn't true. The difference is that for men to have sex, they dont need to enter a womans frame. They havent submitted to her and her reality, but the reverse happens for women. He was always simply building and expanding his frame, allowing women to enter temporarily. She on the other hand has been jumping from frame to frame. So you see, as a man ascends and sleeps with many women along the way, enjoying them and potentially looking out for a LTR material (if hes at the phase), he is not doing damage to his ability to be loyal and invest heavily in a woman and child. This is because he has never submitted to any one woman's frame, he only built his own. The same cannot be said for a promiscuous woman."

"Exactly. Men and women should be not held to same sexual standard as men. 1 man can impregnate 100 women within a year 1 woman, no matter how hard she tries, cannot be impregnated by 100 men and carry each one's child in 1 year."
"60 DoD 2020: Week 4 Style; Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent, Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty# A Sheep in Sheep's Clothing &#x200B; If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go. You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else. For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else. And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you. You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them. You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you. Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style. &#x200B; # What da Fuck is Style? &#x200B; **Its not about matching your belt with your shoes.** &#x200B; *Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.* ** Orson Welles** &#x200B; A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him. Why? Because his style is a visual representation of who he is. **It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.*** &#x200B; *""Remind yourself. Nobody built like you, you design yourself.""* **- Jay Z** &#x200B; # I'm too hot - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman &#x200B; Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet. Its a value add on on every level. People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it. &#x200B; *""It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.""* **-- G. Bruce** &#x200B; # Developing Your Style &#x200B; *Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.* ** Epictetus** &#x200B; Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort. The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life. And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.* Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think fuck that dude looks good. I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style. But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process; # Fit is King It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.*** You see it all the time fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance. None of this shit works. So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration thats half the work done. # Stick to the Classics &#x200B; *""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""* *** Steve McQueen*** You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.* [Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years. If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits. Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen. # Keep it Simple *Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.* Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics: &#x200B; ***Colour.*** Your colour friends are [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589) black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown. Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match. &#x200B; ***Less is more*** &#x200B; *All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret the simpler the better.* ** Cary Grant** &#x200B; The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of. *You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.* So learn to choose carefully or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch. # Steal from Your Icons *One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.* ** Cary Grant** &#x200B; If you look at any famous creative people musicians, artists, designers, film makers none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.

One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you. The difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1). These are two areas where you simply cannot skimp on. [Cheap shoes](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) kill any outfit stone dead.

Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic. If you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear. &#x200B; **Shop online** A retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why. Youre also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain. So shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe youll never wear it. &#x200B; **Never Go Full Retail** All designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites. Other places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail. &#x200B; ***Looking good isnt self-importance; its self-respect.*** ** Charles Hix**"
"60 DoD 2020: Week 4 Style; Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent, Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty# A Sheep in Sheep's Clothing &#x200B; If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go. You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else. For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else. And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you. You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them. You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you. Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style. &#x200B; # What da Fuck is Style? &#x200B; **Its not about matching your belt with your shoes.** &#x200B; *Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.* ** Orson Welles** &#x200B; A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him. Why? Because his style is a visual representation of who he is. **It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.*** &#x200B; *""Remind yourself. Nobody built like you, you design yourself.""* **- Jay Z** &#x200B; # I'm too hot - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman &#x200B; Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet. Its a value add on on every level. People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it. &#x200B; *""It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.""* **-- G. Bruce** &#x200B; # Developing Your Style &#x200B; *Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.* ** Epictetus** &#x200B; Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort. The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life. And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.* Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think fuck that dude looks good. I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style. But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process; # Fit is King It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.*** You see it all the time fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance. None of this shit works. So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration thats half the work done. # Stick to the Classics &#x200B; *""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""* *** Steve McQueen*** You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.* [Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years. If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits. Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen. # Keep it Simple *Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.* Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics: &#x200B; ***Colour.*** Your colour friends are [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589) black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown. Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match. &#x200B; ***Less is more*** &#x200B; *All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret the simpler the better.* ** Cary Grant** &#x200B; The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of. *You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.* So learn to choose carefully or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch. # Steal from Your Icons *One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.* ** Cary Grant** &#x200B; If you look at any famous creative people musicians, artists, designers, film makers none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie. Developing your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.

Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic. If you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear. &#x200B; **Shop online** A retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why. Youre also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain. So shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe youll never wear it. &#x200B; **Never Go Full Retail** All designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites. Other places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail. &#x200B; ***Looking good isnt self-importance; its self-respect.*** ** Charles Hix**"

"From pickup, a man gets red pilled, and you see how abysmal the SMP is. A example is Love is Blind. The women were train wrecks mostly. The exception being the black girl. A bit older for my. Liking but i digress. The other is unemployed, student debt, make up visa debt, and abortions. All red flags. Playboy clearly didn't know his worth. I don't have a problem with women wanting a family. I have a problem when her best was spent as a boot call and now wants to play homemaker now that playboy is getting hotter and younger. If he's not in alignment with what you want, move on. Tone down heavy talk until the year mark. Some guys will drag you through your twenties and dtop you off st thirty before getting younger. Dicaprio for example smashes everything hot and young 18-24 only he drops her off at 25."
"Lessons from Documentary ""Liberated: The New Sex Revolution""(Non-native here, Ignore grammatical mistakes) &#x200B; Hello Everyone, I have just watched this documentary which tends to show the reality of this hookup culture particularly focusing on graduates celeberating spring break on florida beaches. Some particular examples I would like to quote, ""It is easier to find FWB than boyfriends"" (girl 1) ""Guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes"" (girl 2) ""I had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation I wanted"" (girl 3) ""I have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity"" (Guy 1) ""Sex is not about love anymore, its about pleasure only. I don't have to know a girl to get into her pants. Let me demonstrate you (goes to demonstrate it)... You see, its so easy, the more intoxicated she is, the more likely she will drop her panties"" (Guy 2) ""I have come with my girlfriend here and I don't mind if she hooks up somewhere \[lol a cuck\]"" (Guy 3) I live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing. I used to believe that I had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but I don't think its true anymore. Its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society. A regulated sexual market is both good for men and women, women retain their pair bonding ability and men don't have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners. Its a win-win situation for almost everyone (almost). Most people confuse TRP with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine. However, the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could (almost) never produce homely virgin girls (with few exceptoins). The rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society, single motherhood, divorce rates, false rape accusations and other social ills. Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. They love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman's satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man. Being alpha is not about banging numerous women, this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e.g. depressing over not losing one's virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals. Is Dan Brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn?. Hence, we should modify who really is Alpha male: 1. Always working on self improvment. 2. Protecting his children and women (unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets). 3. Resisting Feminism and porn culture. 4. Achieving goals. 5. (Add what you think is constructive). The degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim. Although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words. Banging multiple women cannot make our lives better, yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term. I don't think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever. Most men here use TRP knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible. I utilize TRP knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests. I was one of the victims of plantation culture until I came to TRP and received salvation. let me know what do you say."

">Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. to some extent yes. but outside of having a vagina, the average woman is completely useless to everyone. guys must produce something of value, or they don't exist. in western society, women coast by solely on vagina. people forget how bad smartphones were in the 1990s and early 2000s. 20 years later, and everyone has one. sexbots will follow the same technological path, leaving only procreation for bio-women. but artificial wombs will arrive shortly after and you can already get a surrogate for $40k. the price is falling too, not rising. that's astronomically cheaper than marriage, as there's 0% probability you'll ever be divorce raped, and the only way to get cucked is that your DNA testing provider lies to you on your paternity test."

"I moderate a large subreddit. Some time ago, we decided to stop letting people use gendered slurs entirely. No bitch, dick, or pussy. No whore, no slut, no man-ups, no man-child, no fuckboy. The results were the following: * A lot of people got mad about the policy (and still do) * Everyone got nicer * All the comments got more constructive * The amount of whining about the gender double-standard went way, way down and people focused on these specifics of the situation. I honestly didn't expect this to work. Never in my dizziest daydreams did I think this would have much of an impact. But it *did* have an impact. I've actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why that might be. I think that when people use a gendered slur as shorthand and then you take it away from them, they won't rephrase it to the exact same level of vitriol because they don't necessarily mean *that thing they said*. When people stop being able to ask, ""Am I just being a bitch"" and have to ask the question another way, they typically don't go to the most derogatory counterexample. Rarely it is rephrased to ""am I just being angry and controlling for no reason"". They have to clarify what they think being a 'bitch' means, and that could be controlling, manipulative, assertive, mean-spirited, cruel, or crazy. I might also mean a better meaning like, ""Are my expectations unreasonable?"" or ""Am I asking too much to expect that my partner ___"". The way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too. People often will echo ""Yes, you're a bitch"" back, but they will answer ""Am I being unreasonable"" with ""No, boundaries are important"". Gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn't believe. People who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a ""bitch"" to their partner (even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same) will support respectful boundaries, clear communication, and taking responsibility in the next breath. Similarly, telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice. What does that mean? What does one *do* if they actually want to man-up? A large percentage of the time, that evolves into ""Sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings"" which, I think you'll agree, is a weird definition of ""man-up"". What I find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way. You can still call someone an asshole, a piece of shit, a cheater, a loathsome creature, an emotional terrorist. You can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs. You actually don't say much when you tell someone to man-up, quit being a pussy, stop being a fuckboy. When you ask 35 people a day to reword that to make it something else, you realize that no one is really communicating with those words at all. They are just thought-terminating cliches for feelings people mostly never consider."

Your sources listed are all YouTube videos - ignore those, and check *their* sources. And if they don't give their sources then, well, disregard everything they say. Don't have time now, but maybe I'll give it a look tomorrow. > For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women. Prime strawman there. I can just as validly say that *all* people who care about men's or equal rights want women to be subservient maid slaves. Equally valid, in that it's not at all valid. > either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it Many of them, if not most, do. They'd tell you this is all largely a facet of Toxic Masculinity, in which society dictates that men shouldn't seek help in the first place (or else they're weak little bitches), and to your other points, that if a domestic violence case is called in, they arrest the man regardless of the situation because man r strog. Of course, when feminists say this is part of Toxic Masculinity, the brains on the men's rights side tend to turn off and instead focus on attacking feminism as a concept rather than, you know, actually trying to fix the issue. > Other points, is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states Feminists are way ahead of you.

"The Dual Mating Strategies of Men and WomenAlpha Fucks and Beta Bucks is a well documented phenomenon in the Red Pill. Its the so called dual mating strategy that describes a womans instinct to seek sexual opportunities from the alpha (Alpha Fucks) and provisioning opportunities from the beta (Beta Bucks.) It seems generally assumed in the sphere that this strategy is exclusive to women, so this will be my brief attempt to show that a dual mating strategy is also present in men. Across the sphere we see RP men constantly admitting their dual mating strategies. We want to fuck hoes, and marry virgins (low n-counts.) We want a lady in the streets, and a freak in the sheets. Men seek sexual opportunities from the whores, and provisioning opportunities from the virgins. Sigmund Freud expressed this dual mating strategy in his Madonna/Whore Complex: the tendency in men to view any particular woman as either a Madonna or a Whore. Madonnas (dont think of the superstar by this same name, it will confuse you) are women we perceive as pure, submissive, obedient, and faithful. Whores are women we perceive as sluts, large n-count, tattoo-ridden, disobedient, and unfaithful. History is full of men who were in love with their Madonna wives, only to cheat on them with a Whore. In fact many RP players have made careers out of fucking hoes only to eventually marry a woman they perceive as a Madonna. We all carry this Madonna/Whore instinct inside of us, and its quite clearly a dual-mating strategy, if we care to admit it. This dual-mating strategy for both men and women may be a result of pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution societies. The findings of evolutionary psychology suggest that before the Agricultural Revolution sex in humanity was far more polygamous, liberal and free. People tended to sleep around for various reasons without taboo or stigma. Theres a lot in our biology that is evidence of this. This doesnt mean a womans hypergamy wasnt in effect, it just means being a hoe wasnt looked down upon. If this is true its safe to assume that women were hoes for a very long period of time. And this would explain our natural attraction to hoes. Further, pre-Agricultural Revolution, there was no such thing as property, assets, and marriage. Post-agricultural revolution introduced property, assets, and marriage, and this changed sexual relationships forever. People began to think heavily about guarantying their property and resources was passed on to their progeny. Men became interested in women who could guarantee this bequeathment, and women became interested in men who would share their resources. Suddenly virgins and beta men became more attractive. The forces of this new social pressure conditioned women to look for men who could provide provisioning (betas), and those same forces conditioned men to seek women who could be trusted with their resources (Madonnas.) Virgins can be trusted with property and assets more than whores, and beta men can be relied upon to share their resources more than alphas. In this hypothesis, a dual-mating strategy evolved in both men and women out of our ancient past of free and unbridled sex (pre-Agricultural Revolution) and the relatively recent development of commitment sex (post-Agricultural Revolution.) In the RP theres this idea that you must maintain alpha-ness in your relationships at the expense of beta-ness, so that your wife doesnt cuck or leave you. While theres obvious truth to this, we should condition this view against our own dual mating strategy. In the life of a man, a virgin is perceived to be a prize. Sure, nothing turns us on more than a whore, and some married men will fuck them given the opportunity, but many wont. Many married men will stay faithful to their Madonna, even though she doesnt turn them on like a Whore. Understood in this way, we can see that while women may be attracted to Alphas, for them the prize might very well be a Beta. This is why we teach comfort tests. And while some women in relationships will still fuck the Alphas, many of them wont, and will stay faithful to their Beta. AF/BB is not a black and white line, its just an evolved tendency in women, just like the Madonna/Whore complex is an evolved tendency in men. But neither of these tendencies dictate with any certainty how a particular man or woman will act. This is not an excuse for a man to be a little bitch, a real RP man knows how to be both Alpha and Beta. I admit that the theory of AF/BB and Madonna/Whore instincts evolving out of a pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution society might simply be conjecture. But, the evidence that men have a dual mating strategy (like women) is overwhelmingly evident and universal."
"Key difference: a man can train a virgin to be a whore just for him, but a woman can't train a beta to be an alpha."
"Thanks man. Reminders of why I adopted the whole TRP philosophy is exactly what I was aiming for with my post here. I actually just got out of a therapy appt (which prompted this post) and I did try to do that as best I could, because I KNOW how another woman typically reacts when they hear a mans perspective thats through a TRP lens. Theyre shameful and thats what I felt covertly during the appt. Women do not like to hear the truth of how they behave, thats for sure."
"Women hate men who know what they are like, because they know how evil they are themselves, thats why they hate on each other. Stick to your thoughts, dont let em guilt you out of your thoughts."
"Is the therapist female? They are notorious to be unprofessional and personal, projecting their own issues into situations and giving unsolicited views. I am sorry your therapist pathologized your normal male desires. Men are shamed while women are encouraged to follow the things they want, as if men have an obligation to fulfill the womens goals. Its quite hard to stick to your beliefs when everyone around you tries to manipulate and shame you out of it. we are here for you tho"
"Well youre not going to get any arguments from feminists in support of anything like this that places responsibilities on women. As we have seen from the official statements by feminisists Also as society is generally gynocentric, female milatries (espeically of normal popultation ones not private) would mean that we are far less likely to go to war as we dont want to risk the women, in a way we dont see with me who are more disposable.... VIetnam would end in a week if 50,000 women died vs 50,000 men"
"It won't get attacked as much because it's called ""FemaleDatingStrategy"", for now. Later, it'll be ""We gave it a pass because it was FemaleDatingStrategy, we just thought that title was what it was. Turns out they're so hateful and virulent they make the KKK look like the good guys."""
"CMV: Social distancing will be apocalyptic for the dating lives of the 80%, and will cement hookup apps as the primary way sex happens and new relationships start.So first, two things that I'm sure everyone here on this sub agrees on: 1. OLD and hookup apps are heavily biased in favor of women and very physically attractive men. 2. For men not in the top 20% genetically as far as looks go, meeting in person at a bar or party or other social venue is their best bet at pursuing women and giving themselves a chance to act attractively in a way that cannot be shown easily through an OLD profile. Well, now we are living in a time where it is unclear if bars or concert venues or even restaurants will ever return to the way they once were. Even when these establishments open back up its guaranteed that they will have to do so while observing social distancing protocols, limiting the number of patrons and perhaps even the kinds of interactions patrons can have. Basically, almost every single kind of public socializing venue is going to either close permanently or see up to 50% cuts in patronage and profitability, enforced either legally by public health officials, or emerging naturally because people will just be too spooked to go out in large crowds, probably for the foreseeable future. So what's going to happen to dating? People will obviously still need to meet up and have sex, so workarounds will be found. Online dating already accounts for almost half of new relationships, and I think its pretty clear that this trend will accelerate in post pandemic Western society. I can easily see a future where people are posting negative COVID results on their profiles and going about meeting new sex partners privately, rather than risking going into public and exposing oneself to potentially thousands of unverified disease vectors. And, of course, for already naturally risk-averse women, anything less than Chad is now completely not worth the risk. So, take away billy beta's one way of appearing attractive to new women and up the risks of meeting anyone new such that only the Chadliest are worth the effort for women, and, well... That 30% sexlessness rate for young men is going to spike *hard* in the next two years."
Stop being pussies over an existential threat I bet youre out there protesting that covid-19 is fake news.
"**OYS 17**: Mid 30s, 6 186lb, \~12%BF (Navy method), Separated, one kid 3yrs (f) **Week Goals** * One meditation session 20min did three. * 10 min meditation per day 4/7 * Actively reject guilt associated with ex getting rid of this. Boundaries are what will progress me forwards. * Stick to boundaries 9/10 did well here. * Mobility taking some time off then will reset. * Four morning walks 4/4 I think these are good for getting going in the morning. **Reading:** NMMNG, MMSLP, Pook, MAP, Side Bar, Unchained male, models, The Eagle and the Dragon, WOTSM, WISNIFG, The dating playbook for men, The subtle art of not giving a fuck, The Rational Male, Awareness, Meditation Book (40%), NMMNG (35%), Stop walking on eggshells (50%). Sidebar. **Mission:** * Win each day. Be a man I respect. A man of strength, courage and wisdom. **Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.* * Have used slightly higher does of sleeping tablets this week when stress was high. * Run to burn off energy/stress. * Weights three times. * Seem to be putting on some muscle, not sure if its t-cream or increased calories. * Had to take a break from all strengthening exercises for knee, ongoing pain since I pushed too hard which is disappointing as I thought it was getting better. Ill give it a few more days off then reset. **Separation:** * Ex reacted as I predicted to a letter from my lawyer. Im in a difficult position, she has just stopped allowing overnights for bullshit reasons. If I push it I wont see my daughter at all until I get an urgent court application (assuming I do at this time). If I dont push it she feels like she has won and will be encouraged to do this in the future. I have talked to lawyers (two to triangulate what Im being told) Im finding the whole thing extremely frustrating. I dropped daughter off the other day and ex brought it all up in front of her. I said dont talk about it in front of daughter and she kept going at me while I got in car and drove off. * So what am I doing firstly I stopped. I was getting caught up in ego, then I considered a proper time perspective, in 2 years this will all be locked down legally and Ill have most of what I want. So, while it is frustrating and I want to do something the right play is to wait it out (mediation) then have an urgent application ready to go. I will not stop the money during this time although I legally could, it would look like Im retaliating. Previously I had in my mission (and it came back this week because I felt like writing it) Be a man I respect that man would see the frustration and let it pass over him, he would not react to petty ego games to get a short term ego win at the expense of what he really wants in the medium term. He would not forget to think about 2 years from now because something is happening 2 minutes from now. So that is what Im doing, its frustrating but I am going to do what needs to be done to get the best long term outcome. **Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.* * I feel better than I have in as long as I can remember. Ex is being annoying but I am in a strong position because I have done the work to get myself here. Life is only going to get better because Im going to keep doing the work to make it better. Im doing things that I want to do and am starting to craft a vision rather than just letting life happen to me. * Still struggling with the tension of doing what I want and feeling good in the moment and doing what I should do which would progress me towards my goals but does not feel good and goes against some internal resistance. * Following [u/Tyred\_Biggums](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyred_Biggums/) comment last week I have been thinking about Shame/needy partners and selfishness. Im not sure what I want to do for me, I did the NMMNG activity on this and have a few items. Most of these dont raise any issues e.g. I want to do a rally driving course and probably will. But there are a few that get to other issues. One is own a nice car, buying myself a nice car seems selfish because you could spend that money on the greater good. Im not sure 100% where this comes from but my parents have a part. I imagine my dad being disappointed in my decision. Im clearly still not living in my own frame if Im worried about things like that in the first place. Also, looking at shame and picking needy women I think they are two separate issues that feed into each other. I pick needy women because it makes me feel safe, they need me and so I dont have to worry. I feel shame because I feel like having any needs is wrong and will result in love being taken away, I am defective just by having needs. This feels so typical nice guy that I kept looking for something else but that is what it is. I try to have no needs, I dont inconvenience, I am always trying to do the right thing, when you combine that with picking a needy women and a fear of being alone you get my relationships and my codependency issues. * Im not sure why I am so worried about being lonely/alone. Sometimes I find MRP very nihilistic and feel empty, Im still not sure what to replace that with. I go camping on my own quite a bit and feel happy and fine when Im doing that but with others I still chase something from that connection that I cant ever get. I need to spend more time thinking about this. Or maybe I dont, maybe I just want to have a nice car a fuck a pair of 19 year olds Im not sure yet. **Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.* * Im concerned my ex is coaching our daughter to say she doesnt want to stay at my house. There have been a few things she has said that leads me to believe this. * Im worried about exs mental state and the effect that is having on our daughter e.g. her picking up on the anxiety. She has had some tantrums lately, I just try and be there not making a big deal about it all and making sure she knows I love her. * My plan is to be a stable and safe place where she is always welcome and loved. Im listening to more Janet Lansbury podcasts while I wait for the book to arrive. This is giving me a lot of material to work with. **Shit to Own:** * Used porn again to feel better not sure if I should focus on cutting this now. Its not a huge problem and Im focusing on other things. Long term I will need to at least run periods without it. * Still think about the relationship sometimes and indulge myself here. Second guessing my decision, thinking how maybe I could make it work etc. * Scared of being alone. * Not sure where to go next with my development. I have had that feeling a lot and will just keep pushing and see where I end up."
"Am I attracting women with mental health issues or is every woman carry heavy mental health issues?Every single woman I get close to has some mental health issue. Not one single woman I've slept with or dated has had a healthy mental health background. Some outright mention their issues on the first few dates whereas some mention it few months down the line. Almost every girl seems to have had an episode of clinical depression. Some are on pills. Some have had self-harm or suicidal tendencies. Half of them have needed counselling. The rest half feel they don't 'need' a counselor. Literally. Every. Single. Woman. I know intimately is riddled with mental health issues. While I sympathize with them, this shit makes me not want to ever get in a relationship or a ltr with any girl ever. What about you guys? How many of the girls you've known well have had mental health issues? Am I just attracting this type or are majority women fucked up in the head?"
"Yes, every girl under the age of 35 these days has some form of mental health problem. I have fucked about 30 girls in the last 2 years and every single one of them had some sort of mental health issue that made them difficult to be with / sabotage the relationship Which is why you don't give women any commitment. Bc they will just spit it back in your face anyhow"
"Right off the bat ask them about their family. If the dad isn't in the picture just leave it at one date. You may feel sorry for these women or that you can 'nurse them back to health' but don't waste your time. No matter how good you are to them, when it ends, you'll be called an abusive asshole. But yea most western women today have a myriad of mental health issues stemming from our contemporary experience. The amount of women going for a PhD I come in contact with who really are just doing it for the clout will astound you. Most women want a career because they've been told to want one. Most women actually want to have children. The longer you live with a woman the more you'll notice how much like a child they are."
">Right off the bat ask them about their family. If the dad isn't in the picture just leave it at one date Good point. I can attest to most of them having some parental issue. Either one of the parent not being in picture. Or the dad being an alcoholic, domestic violence etc"
"25% of women have some diagnosis of mental health issue. Thats dangerous, because that means that 75% are walking around undiagnosed."
"I forget the link but I read a wonderful little article once called something along the lines of ""Every girl under 25 is a cenobite these days"". Very accurate, very disgusting."
"If you improve youself so much, why would you need a girl?This is a very genuine question. Game theory aside, you'll find that one of the most recommended advises on the seduction community is to work on yourself instead of chasing women. Hell, learning about seduction and game is in itself self improvment. From my experience. I have reached states where I was very, very mature. I was neither angry nor impatient nor insecure nor needy. I was confident, calm, smooth, rational, fun but not forcibely, everything was so genuine about me, and I felt totally in synch with myself. What I noticed about those moments, aside from the inner peace I had. Is that people just followed me. If I was with a girl then seducing her was not necessary, Hell I didn't have to talk or say anything, I could sit there with a girl totally silent and somehow I could feel that she's enjoying my company. Same with guys. And when I said let's go there or do that and I lead, they just followed, no questions asked, no ""Why!! we can't, it's better to do that and that"" It was a great feeling. But I am unable to stay in that state for very long. This made me wonder, if I improve myself to the point where I'm in that state most of them time, what would I need girls for apart from sex? I mean everybody will talk about not being needy when you want a girl, but if you're not needy and abundant, why would you need her? This is a very genuine question and not a condescending one as it may seem, I'm hoping for genuine answers."
Feminists are the cause of this discrimination in the first place.
"Nah man I think they're both valid terms-- I think ""Not My Nigel"" is a little more maternal, e.g. what you were talking about with moms protecting their sons from the evil golddigging whores and whatnot, but ""poor baby"" is pretty universal (moms, girlfriends, sisters, friends, etc.)."
"Western Society was built because of the culture of monogamy where the bottom 80% of men made major contributions. These contributions were made in exchange for access to reproduction they wouldnt normally have access to (due to socially enforced monogamy, religion, patriarchy) If majority of men truly become incel, society will crumble and devolve back to the days when the 80/20 rule was even more apparent 8000 years ago when [17 women reproduced for every 1 man](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success) Women's mating strategies/preferences are not selected for advanced societies. They select for muscles, broad shoulders, height, jawline - traits that were advantageous in ancient times rife with tribal warfare. They don't select for IQ which is necessary for advanced western civilizations The feminist pipe dream is to revert to our primal mating strategies (for women) while retaining all the benefits provided by the unworthy masses of men giving rise to modern civilization. Good luck to them all. A modern western society cannot exist when hypergamy is fully realized like 8000 years ago. Yes, muh lady will be more free but society will devolve"
"It will be possible when feminism and other soul destroying movements like them to at least change their name to Women's Rights, so maybe than they can give the right to a human being, not a fake victim. Speaking of that, I've just seen a video of a rapper or some sort threatening and abusing his pregnant girlfriend while he streamed it live! It was a couple of week ago, and no feminist red headed social worriors talked about that, it makes you think."
"Yeah, women see an attractive guy and assume his personality is amazing without even talking to him."
"don't you know this just by personal experience? or you never left your house ? Personality used to be a thing in the 19th and 20th century. Unless you can find a very poor girl who lives in fucking nowhere , enjoys reading books and whose dream is to be a mother. Then yes, maybe personality would matter. bro."
"Oh fuck off with this healthy at any size shit. Men have a natural liking to women with a healthy amount of meat of their bones...because a women who is at a healthy weight for their body dimension is the best fit for pregnancy and breastfeeding. Its called evolution. Yes, there are men that little petite women who look like stick figures and other men who love land whales...those are called statistical outliners. Its ironic that SJWs bitch that the people shouldnt be concerned about who someone loves, when it concerns interracial and homosexual relationships...which no shit love who you love; yet these harpies hate that a there are people arent sexually attracted to land whales or transgenders, or even admonished people who love petite women."

I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""* I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up: *""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""* *""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""* She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while. The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there. So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me) Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama. --- **What do I take from this?** * She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on. * Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn. * Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.** * It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy. * If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation. * Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet. **TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**"
"She'll never tell you what she really means.I come back to this sub after a 2 year hiatus of regular dwelling. I checked in from time to time, but I never stopped reading books, learning and improving myself. First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus. Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT. --- So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy. As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later. We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context: *""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""* *""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""* *'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""* *""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'* *""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""* I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around. A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying. Gives me the good old speech: *""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this.

"Yeah, IF you can get plates on a rotation you will have that drama sometimes, but the sex will be constant. &#x200B; In a LTR that goes to kids (we want offspring or at least the majority) you will make sacrifices as the sex won't be so good. She knows pretty well she has the upper hand as a gatekeeper of sex in that position. You will have to game her constant, make her desirable and overall make sacrifices of your free time. And when the kids come you will have dry years to come. &#x200B; So tell me why you need to be affected by a plate going broke? I know that the majority of guys here, including me want an unicorn that will be dtf and easy to live with in the long term, but that is unrealistic and 99.99% of the time won't happen. Also it's easier to go into a relationship as you will have her available and you won't have to waist time to pursue other women. But this is not productive and will eat your free time and go against your goals."
A woman always presents the opposite of what she really thinks. Honest women are few. You have to look for her uncontrolled reactions.
My brain immediately translated the I love you to You make me feel so good that I thought I missed it when you were talking about it in the conclusion. Everything she says she has said in a way to cover up the real truth and paint herself as the good guy. No wonder your typical man cant understand women nor why women cant understand themselves when theyre so fluent at lying to themselves.
"I don't think women actually understand morality, they only understand social consequences and if people aren't watching her, she can't be held accountable. A good example of this is the whole invaderzie situation where she demanded money and once she became highly criticized by the majority of people she caved. She didn't actually act morally, and she probably doesn't really understand what she did wrong but a woman can't handle when most people don't like them. The reason I bring up morality is because this thread is largely about women being dishonest and.I consider that to be immoral"

"I Have Been Doing Cold Approach For 2 Years Now: This Is How I Went From Kissless Handholdless Virgin To 15 Lays In 1 Month&#x200B; About 3 years ago, I was a 29 year old Asian guy with only a couple months to go before I turned 30, working at a Big 3 Accounting Firm, and I was realizing that I was unhappy and miserable, working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing Overwatch, and Dota 2 And despite earning good money, I had a house and some savings, I just knew my life was NOWHERE near where I wanted it to be or thought it SHOULD be, despite all the years of hard work because I was FOREVER ALONE. I was still a virgin at age 29. A kissless handholdless virgin I just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since I have nothing better to do during the quarantine. I soon decided, with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on RedPill titled HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD that this was not the life for me and that I would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30 I didn't want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined: * I just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that I missed out on. * I just wanted to have someone I could share my hopes and struggles with, someone I could come home to and hug if I had a bad day. * I just wanted to have some fun before I get married and start a family Was that really too much to ask? So I quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed Reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach. I soon discovered, however, that I had bitten off far more than I could chew I met up with a white guy I met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together. Every time we went out, he would always go home with a new girl, mostly Asian girls Im not proud of it, but I was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of IOIs or other signs of attraction when I approached, and stopped going out with him. Now, I realize it's because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut, but back then, It was kind of ridiculous how Id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a GO AWAY vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and THE SAME GIRL would be smiling and asking him questions about himself, it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid At this point, I was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis, trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques. It felt like I hit a brick wall. This was SOOO much harder than I thought it would be. The HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case. I was a 55 Asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club I went to and it felt like no matter what I said, no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me. This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort. So reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing. For those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter. I finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems I went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10"", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn. The bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife But finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me. The first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed. Next, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance The one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO. Thats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up. Hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post. Just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again."

"All those gurus who say that look does not matter don't want to loose their potential clients who lacks in looks department, so its best for their business, but the thing is you need to look presentable and have some decent dressing sense. You can relate it with the HR screening, then after that you will be evaluated on your skill set that is the minimum requirement for the initial stage. Chicks who spend hours on their physical appearance and try to hide any imperfections they have but you won't judge on looks is bullshit lie, they do but that doesn't mean you need to look like model just be presentable take care of you basic hygiene and then evaluate what needs improvement next."
"It's all in the eyes. Keep in mind that women are attracted to you too, it's just a matter of catching the ones who are instead of working hard for the ones on the fence."
"The Power Of Teasing - Building Major Sexual Desire In WomenWomen are not use to men rejecting or teasing them. The hotter she is, the less likely a man has teased or rejected her. As a matter of fact, if he has, this is the guy she finds the most intriguing. ""Why are you playing games with women"" This is a game that women play with men all the time. When a man does it back to her, it disarms her. I wrote a post called [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women. So how do you tease a woman? First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck. Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere. The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone. Don't give a woman everything she wants. When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored. Keep your conversations short. When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more. So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you. Her: ""What? You have to leave? You just got here!"" in a whiny voice. You: ""Yeah. I gotta go. I have to leave for work tomorrow"" Her: ""Wanna spend the night? I can wash what you're wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow"" This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this. But you get the idea. When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date. Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to. The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have. If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you. If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen."

They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). Our AFC is a 5. The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player. It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut. Stop trying to be friends first. Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point. Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey. **However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas** Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible. 2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP. Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5. Then they can graduate to TRP. **Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill** The balding, 5'3, Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys. This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed. The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. Eventually the manlets, autists and indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings. Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies. Some guys peak at 5. ""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly. This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP. All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill"

"Breakups are fun, you get to move onto new pussy."
"Finally got laid, push and pull technique was the best.I wish I had read the advices and tips from this sub when I was still younger. I had horrible experience in dating with women before. All went sour because I was too needy. Thanks everyone on this sub. The push and pull technique really worked! And for me, it's the best method to get women. Women are more driven by emotion than logic. They get ""aroused"" when they get curious about you. I gave her different signals. I am not predictable. I made sure she is always confused. I stopped obsessing about her. Before, I was checking her online status and social medias 24/7. I went out to play soccer/football, get a job, kept myself busy and play video games to stop being needy all the time. I realized I was talking and chatting her through the phone all day. When I read about this sub, I immidietly stopped that hobby. She got attached to me because we were constantly chatting, so I decided to ""push"" her away by not replying her messages instantly. Declined her coffee and pizza invitations. Declined to play video games with her. I didn't make myself available all the time. Now she is thinking about me. Then I make my self available and chat to her always, then again go cold for a while - repeat. Making her really confused. ""Does he like me or not?"" This created more attraction. But it's really hard to control yourself. I just made myself busy to stop being needy. Never confess your feelings to your crush. Why? Because she gets bored, she is no longer curious because she already got the answer. When women fall in love to you, they become ""obssesed"". They no longer give a shit to your wealth and physical appearance."
"This is the key to making a relationship last and to getting girls wet over you. Girls like emotion, they like uncertainty. Don't constantly shower her with attention. Sometimes when I'm texting my girlfriend, I say that I'm busy today and that I'll get back to her later. Sometimes I'll act a little cold and she'll immediately start wondering why. It keeps her curious and engaged. One day you want her to feel happy, the next sad, the next a little angry, and the next day you want her horny. Keeping a cycle of emotions going is the best thing you can do to have her go crazy for you."
"MGTOW isn't a niche group anymore. MGTOW is becoming the norm.Based on the number of cases, studies and articles in power imbalance, in divorce cases, in percentages of relationships/marriages failing, in double standards, the adele divorce case, the Johnny Depp case... men have realized the following: 1 - The term *SIMP* has achieved a global status (i would not be surprised that it would be included in the dictionary sometime in the future). This means that a conscious realization has occurred, and for it having such a mass appeal worldwide, it means that it isn't just cultural relativism/subjectivism. Millions of men have suffered through the dichotomy of -> Conquering Women = Suffering, otherwise the term *SIMP* needn't be so sucessful; 2 - With the pragmatic, yet flawed, #METOO movement, men have spoken how much they suffered from this view of trying to be with women. This point with 1 has something in common: Something is really all fucked concerning approaching women. ""*This shouldn't be so difficult...so why is it? Is it me that's the problem?"";* 3 - Seeing so many men suffering from this exact way (and it not need mattering if a man is a 2/10 or a 10/10. Suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men, it seems) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman, we reach a conclusion: *Something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* (otherwise there wouldn't be so many niche groups like mgtow/men's rights/whereareallthegoodmen. It's reactionary and even error theory assuming that ""*we're all losers and incels"". Correlation doesn't mean Causation*, however, when that correlation continues to go on without stopping, a conclusion has to be made); 4 - With such a conclusion, we go searching for more information: We find books (the manipulated men, the rational male, the works of Briffault), we find articles (divorce rapes, cheating scandals, emotional bullying cases), and, eventually, this kind of subreddit, MGTOW (maybe TRP). With the axioms that these subreddits apply...well, they just make sense. Everything fits. We start to connect the pieces. Briffaults's Law, Hypergamy, Monkey Branching, abandoning relationships for no reason, Shit Tests...It's impossible for this to be just me! Every guy i've known has suffered through the exact same way. So we start talking to our male friends... and we all agree on these premisses. 5 - We, naturally, keep reading and being informed about this. We start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend, a woman in our lives, and just stop (or limit) our necessity of approaching women. We start to live more. We are more sane. We are healthier (some of us even go to the gym!). We start taking care of ourselves for ourselves. We start not caring about social media. 6 - Now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity, and are simply better not caring about women (although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women), we start not giving a crap. Women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy. Feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *Incel, Loser* or *Beta* to shame test us (like we haven't predicted that by this point). You know, a typical Strawmen/Ad Hominem. 7 - The cycle repeats here. Now, with our knowledge about this concern, we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated (onlyfans, twitch girls, youtube girls, e-girls) and call them by reason, to wake them up. ""Why do you think that onlyfans exploded? It's not because they can't get employability or good jobs. It's not because it's ""difficult"" out there. Prosmicuity and sexual themes have exploded in the past decade, and females are the bread winner. They can have their cake and eat it. They can have more sexual partners and be paid for it, without having any beneficial labour for the rest of society. They can go on any social dating app and just pick. *You are NOT going to have sex with her*."" MGTOW is the way. Suffering is bound to happen without it."
"The reason twitch thots, onlyfans, etc is so popular is because guys are buying intimacy, not sex. I think there will be a branching off point and similar parallel path for those MGTOWs that have also taken the Waifu Pill for their intimacy needs."
Women keep peeling back the layers of their THOTery. I'm looking forward to the next 7 years.
Women are hypocrites. Nothing to see here.
"CMV: Most men believe the myth that ""women care less about sex"" because most men arent desired by women.Women want/love sex just as much as men. But they specifically want it from top men. The top men, who women lust after, know how much women enjoy sex because they see it. Most men are rarely lusted after by women, even their own girlfriends (beta bucks and whatnot). They think its just because ""women care less about sex"" when its actually because women dont care about sex *with them.*"
"when a woman says ""a man"" it means a man she doesn't completely discount and ignore. Women have no empathy for majority of men and just flat out ignore them. Women consider only certain men as men at all. The rest of men have the same status as family or objects like telephone poles. They pay attention just enough to not walk into them and they vanish from their entire worldly thought."
"No. If this were true the Chads of the world would regularly have to be put down from exhaustion. Women would go psychotic over them like Karens go about HOA issues. Seriously you would see women kill each other over apex men regularly (at least as regularly as men kill their partners) since theyre so rare. I mention the killing bc the male sex drive comes from testosterone. Other stuff: STDs would be not just a moderate risk for freaks but would grind entire healthcare systems to a halt. Everyone would be pregnant all the time if they werent on birth control. If female desire for just random thoughtless monkey fucking matched the male drive (even just for some men), YOU WOULD KNOW IT."
"Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*. Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general. Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex. If they did, society and culture would look completely different. Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it. Women just aren't into it. Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date. You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience. Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"". Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women. If women pursued sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on. And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life. So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't. Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts. Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors. Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero. if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that. Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them. Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do. Women don't give a shit about sex. Not really. they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that? Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole. Whereas women don't think a hard cock is a hard cock, which is why they have 500000 requirements to fuck, whereas a man just requires a woman to be willing and available."

It's only hypocrisy if you believe they have any standards other than fuck men that disagree with me in any way. The reaction to Kavanaugh compared to Biden should tell you everything you need to know.

"**OYS #4** Country still has no lockdown. Stats: age mid 30, married to wife (mid 30), 3 kids (2, 5, 7). Height 5'9"". Weight: 76 kg (167 lbs). Strong lift 5x5, B 55 kg,+5 OHP 45 kg, DL 70 kg, SQ 90 kg, ROW 50 kg. Still reading some of the sidebar, The Book of Pook, The seduction method. WISNIFG. **Physical/training** Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week. **Marriage/How not to do MRP** Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good. After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down (crying and asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed. Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good. Failings: \- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit \- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol) \- Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that) \- No real OI when facing denial/indifference. Success (I think) \- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats. \- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly) \- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval) \- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account""). **Mental** Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes. **Sex** After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz. **Family** Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great. **Social** Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends. **Week goals** \- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success) \- No losing calm at all (2 week success) \- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend) **Shit owning / Goals** \- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue) \- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week) \- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot. ~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here. ~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though. \- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame. ~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.) \- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there) **Mission** *Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.* \- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle. \- Be financially independent before 60"

Hoping to do this every week. **Marriage/How not to do MRP** Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good. After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down (crying and asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed. Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good. Failings: \- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit \- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol) \- Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that) \- No real OI when facing denial/indifference. Success (I think) \- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats. \- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly) \- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval) \- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account""). **Mental** Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes. **Sex** After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz. **Family** Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great. **Social** Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends. **Week goals** \- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success) \- No losing calm at all (2 week success) \- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend) **Shit owning / Goals** \- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue) \- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week) \- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot. ~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here. ~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though. \- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame. ~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.) \- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there) **Mission** *Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.* \- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle. \- Be financially independent before 60"

Occasional dips, pullups, and pushups at local park. BW exercises. 60DoD Week6: Finances I have been aggressively tackling credit card debt since last year. Im forecasting to be free of credit card debt NLT the end of this year. My student loan, is a different monster, but not too unwieldly, and I expect to pay it off within the following year or so. I am using Dave Ramseys Snowball + Debt Avalanche Method on paying off debt. So, what can be done during these DoD and going forward? 1. I have at least a year and half or more remaining (at my current take home pay + side income) for debt payoff.Stick with my plan. Any extra income goes into paying off debt. More importantly, do not accumulate more debt. 2. Prep. Ive begun mentally planning for saving for a down payment for a house. According to DR, I should be paying off debt first, but Ive heard otherwise, from other reliable sources. Either way, Id like to be rid of credit card debt, first. 3. Budget. As with a lot of my problems, making a plan and sticking to it is my weakness. The problem right now is not overspending, its not controlling and managing where and to what my money goes. 4. Control. Self-control is key. My wife is on an allowance and I should also put myself on an allowance to be honest, in order to more effectively tackle my debt and save. Week 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily. Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat. Week 3: Hygiene, Hair, Etc. Developing healthier routines. Week 4: Style: Updating current style. Prepping for summer and fall. Week 5: Game: Actively gaming wife. Still have yet to purchase a book on game, but have been following PoNs advice on game. Need to game randos. **Read:**TRM, NMMNG, MAP **Reading:** Cant Hurt Me, 'Bigger, Leaner, Stronger,NMMNG (BF activities), Atomic Habits **Career/Work:** *From last week:Asking myself how my work/career can contribute to my mission. How can I position myself to come out ahead after the dust settles with this Covid-19 situation? What do I want to do? Where do I see myself in x years?* I have an idea of where and how I want to live. How can/should I plan my career around this? I want my career to supplement my lifestyle, not the other way around. I.E. I have to live in the city, because thats where my office is AND commuting team is more bearable. Id rather live in a location and house that I love, and have a job/business that compliments/works well with that. **This week:** Ive been enjoying the time off doing necessary stuff around my apartment, getting ready for the upcoming summer. Prepping kids to sleep in their own room, study, and just going through the motions. It all feels like one big blur. I cant remember what the fuck I did last week. I havent been writing in my journal as I should. Im still a lazy faggot. I did fuck up my work out routine this past week, as it was my wifes birthday. I slept in, ate shit, and didnt work out as I shouldvebummer. I have very little discipline, still. My nutrition plan is okay at best, but I make too many exceptions in other areas. Ive realized that I dont have the self-control or discipline it takes, yet, to cut loose a little bit, then be back on the grind the next moment. So I really need to create environments, according to Atomic Habits, where I set myself up for success. Id love to hear from you guys on how you dealt with a lack of discipline or built more self-control. *Kids:* One area I am constantly failing in, is patience with my son. I love my boy, and I understand that if I dont unfuck myself I could inadvertently create a Nice Guy who hates his father. This upcoming off-period, I am going to actively focus on being patient and better with him. **Further thoughts:** Discipline. Self-Control. Priorities. **Pain is Weakness leaving the body. Onward.**"
But why? What's the explanation for her not having to do normal jail time (except pussy).
pussy
"Bitch should be in jail, criminal record, and have her wages deducted for the next 18 years for his pain. She could have blinded him."
Womens basic life strategy is that of spoilt child: cry for whatever you want whenever you want it.
"""Childish"" to women is a man doing too many things that don't directly benefit a woman. If he isn't serving a woman or piling up resources a woman can land on when she's bucked off the cc, he's being childish. Peter Pan. It's especially objectionable to them if he's doing it with other guys, thereby preventing them from doing something that serves women. When a man is doing something he detests that serves the interests of a woman (and her children), that's when he's being least childish in their eyes. That's when he's a good man. That's when he's a 'real man'. Self-sacrifice in order to give her what she wants but doesn't need and shouldn't accept. But they still won't fuck him much. They prefer fuckbois to 'real men'."

"How to be Alpha AND likeable?Hey guys. Since becoming more alpha Ive actually lost friends rather than gained them. I get girls more easily but men seem to be threatened by me and theyre passive aggresive/purposely leaving me out of events etc. Also new men I meet who are physically more beta/dont workout are passive aggressive toward me even when I am nice to them and dont compete with them. Sometimes this happens with other jacked men too. Just before lockdown started, I went to a bar with friends and was hooking up with a friend of a friends gf. We were all there together and I started getting attention from some other girls. Another woman (few years older) tried to hit it off with me in front of everyone and I played it cool and she left for a bit. I didnt initiate anything. Then I went to the toilet and she followed me. My friend clocked it and came to grab me.. he told her to piss off and was angry with me. He said I was supposed to be dating his gfs friend and I wasnt strong enough with the other woman but I could tell he was just jealous that I got attention and he didnt. He was punching me in the ribs calling me stupid but to me it was a translation for Im angry that you got so much attention and I cant get that Now Im a nice guy. Even when I know other men cant compete with me I dont rub it in their face because honor and respect. And getting girls isnt the goal of my life. I actually want real bros. It just pisses me off that they cant see that and by being nice I get treated like shit its weird. I didnt do anything wrong with this woman. I got attention that I didnt look for. So my question is how do you be Chad AND likeable at the same time? My friends joke that I look like a fuckboy which means they subconsciously think I look like I fuck a lot of women but they only put a negative spin on it because they cant do the same. They have left me out of the pack so many times as if Im some dishonourable guy who chooses hoes over bros but I never do. My female friend whos a PHD biologist (a very logical female whos honest about hypergamy) told me that Im a threat to 90% of men. Also at the bar my friends gf told me when she was drunk that Im really handsome and every girl at the bar probably wants to fuck me. My friend didnt hear and neither did the girl I was dating. (Her friend) So what am I doing wrong and how do I become more likeable? It seems that men dont respect me for whatever reason. Are betas more liked by everyone because theyre softer and more agreeable? I mean Im never an asshole to people but Im always strong in my convictions and never lie. I thought this would command respect from other people but it doesnt seem to. Hmm or maybe thats not it. Its just I have this one friend who everyone loves but hes not alpha at all. Hes adopted the new age mantra and is all about positive vibes etc. Im not like that as Im a realist, but Im not an asshole either. So I dont get it. What do you think?"
A group of like 14 year old girls gagged at me in the mall like a day before my bday. A few weeks before I went to buy a present for my sis and got accused of shoplifting presumable for looking bunny. I was just trying to find the fucking product. In a dept store btw full of Stacy's... Imagine being put on blast like that..
"Why? So you could karma whore? People could take anything from there and post it in circlejerk subs.

I have to agree that self confidence and how you carry yourself boosts your image but just by 1-2 points. Maybe a high becky can be a Stacy or a normie can jump to a low level Becky. But I'm already ugly as fuck maybe a 3/10 and if I change my dressing style and feel more secure and confident in how I carry myself I don't see myself crossing the 5/10 to even be a normie. I have to go under the knife to even come out remotely close to the average girl. This is just some bullshit stuff

What the actual fuck is wrong with this chick. And it's not just her there's a large group of women who truly believe that this is what men talk about privately or behave when no one is watching and its absolutely deplorable. This reminds me of the woman who went undercover as a man to prove that men are toxic and joined a bowling league and was shocked when she was welcomed and treated kindly even after she revealed herself to be a woman. I swear these dumbasses are wilfully living in a fantastical hellish nightmare world of their own creation just to play the victim.
"They get over it, dont worry too much, it just shows youre human. In a month shell be getting railed by someone else anyway."
"In nature women depended on men for protection and food, basically survival needs. This generally made women move on earlier than men in relationship, because they needed protection from another man they moved on earlier. And crying, self-deprecating and stuff like that are manipulation at basic level. She'll get someone new in months, wait for it. And feeling bad for something that you were socially programmed to think is bad is part of being human, don't beat yourself up for feelings. Just take your time for a few days, then move on."
"Women don't care about your emotions, don't care about theirs."
Damn man whenever I see woman cry because of that kind of situation I always assume they trying hard to manipulate you.
"Bro have some self respect. She's doing all this cause she knows your ass will still be there begging to smash. Focus on other things like your hobbies and other women. You're tripping over a chick that fucks every dude she meets. Your time with her is up. She was never yours, it was just your turn. Stay grinding man"
"""violated by cops"".. yeah.. She has to put her clothes on in **this** room and not in another room. Not even in accompaniment with a female cop. Why? Maybe a dog in the other room? Or a gun? Or jason voorhees? Maybe its a safe-room? Put your clothes on in this room and follows order and dont throw a FUCKING TANTRUM because you don't get what you want. Thats typical woman behavior. Play the victim-card, argue, get cocky, yelling, get violent, crying, blame all other."
"She said she drugged and robbed men when they thought they were going to have sex witch is most definitely a crime, Donald Trump, before he was president using his money and business status to grab them by the Pussy obviously not actually just grabbing women by the vagina, but simply seducing them by flexing massive amounts of cash or whatever is just seduction. Its definitely a tool move but women love that shit and it works almost every time. But theyre completely different things..."
The problem with this is she can just say she made it up. Unless her victims come forward there is no case. Thise were all Johns paying prostitute for sex. They probably wont want to be public about it. Even if they are the type to not worry about that. Do you think they actually know the haggard prostitute that drugged them years ago is Cardi B? She must look completely different now Who cares about a couple dudes who got drugged while committing a crime. I have no sympathy for them anyway. The real victims of Cardi B is the general public. The idea that my daughter could one day idolize a fucking crack whore sucks.

"Discovered LTR's cheating activity from 2017Nexted her immediately. I had access to her mail, so i easily got into her Facebook... Checkin wassup, found, some hooking up in 2017(in college) with several guys that year. And it was said to be our best year together. Thing is, during that time, that month, i had a gut feeling something wasn't connecting... So big lesson is, your gut feeling is almost never wrong. One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation, she chocked . I wasted, college fucking and my time , but that is alright. I cry not. Things are looking good for me past school, i have had offers coming in, now i am just picking the one's with high value. I am quite happy with this breakup, because man, i have been wanting out, i just needed a legitimate reason for leaving now i finally caught the bitch. Anyway, i am yet another victim, 5year LTR, i met TRP, 3 years ago. Count me out in exclusive dating, this bitches got none to offer other than pussy.. So not like i lose anything."

"Lol of course. That's why I made a new account and stopped subbing or posting on normie subs. All they do is downvote the shit out of you until you're posting quota capped and/or shadow banned. You don't even have to get formally banned, they just abuse the karma system to ensure that you never challenge their pathetic worldview. If you do ever want to argue with the opposing sides a little, you're better off posting on right wing subs because there will be just enough of an opposing side presence for you to have an argument, but, enough people will agree with you that you'll stay in positive karma and avoid being shut out. Or just post in places like this and forget these faggelas even exist at all."

"Your ability to break the rules is a powerful red pill truthI was sipping morning coffee and going over the worldnews sub when I came upon an article that mentioned how Japan is still reliant on fax machines and shit to report on Covid. These people are required to go into work just to stamp documents. Someone in that sub asked ""can't they bring the stamp home?"", which lead to the following response: >A question that only someone thats never lived in Japan would ask. >There doesnt need to be any practical or logical reason for a rule >Rules no matter how trivial are followed without question >People actually go into a sort of shock if you violate a rule >For example my wife once tried to order hot takeaway milk from a Mr Donuts. >The server explained that you can takeaway coffee etc but not hot milk because you might not drink it right away and it could go bad and then make you sick. Long nonsense discussion >My wife proceeds to order a hot milk to eat there and asks for an empty takeaway cup. At this point we assumed the server knew what was going to happen next because she gave my wife the milk and the cup without question and there really was only one explanation for wanting the empty cup. >When my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded. >The sort of rule breaking that my wife just did literally doesnt ever happen in Japan. This absolutely blew my mind. Apparently following rules is so burned into their culture, that they wouldn't even consider breaking even minor rules. Another comment in the same thread mentions how you can't even order an omelette without rice. You have to order the omelette with rice, then throw the rice out while the server stares in disbelief . >Then my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded. Which got me thinking about the blue pill ""rules"" here in north america in context to the red pill (get a gf, get married, get her pregnant, pay her cash and prizes when she's ready to move on, and don't you dare deviate from that path you fucking sonofabitch!). I realized our ability to say ""fuck this I'm gonna spin plates, avoid marriage, enjoy the decline, etc"" results in the same ""ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah short-circuiting in blue pill programmed individuals. . ""Seducter, you can't fuck her, she's married! ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah . Not only did I fuck her, but I sent her ass home to the husband who's cooking supper for her and the kids. Just seeing that comment thread made me really appreciate the freedom that we have. To be able to break free from society's conditioning and do what we want. Imagine freezing up in a firestorm of cultural programming and indecisiveness because someone asked you if they could borrow your shovel. Thank fuck for the red pill."

"High n count and long term relationships. Red Pill truths confirmed by a plate.TL;DR: A plate of mine confirmed red pill truths about how her having a very high N count resulted in not a single meaningful long term relationship that she so wanted to have. We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story. This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here)."

I think theres more problems in her life. When youre 25 still living with your family in the back seat of a car with a guy you just met online I really have to wonder what the slut phase was.
i think her slut phase never ended. it's just the hamster spinning.
"yup yup! It's diffucult to unlearn beauty ideals, especially when society reminds you every day that you're ugly. but I love faking confidence.

"This man is nothing more than a loser, which it is bad enough to get with a trashy divorced woman but then to marry and get the same trashy woman pregnant was beyond insane.....I couldn't care less how much money and fame that the guy has as I have one thing that he'll never EVER have and that is ""freedom"" to live my life on my own terms. Enjoy your prison sentence ex prince of simps."
"first you leave, get 3 knives and a gun. Then slap her, if the guys attack then you have proper self defense against a mob."
Dude if I were him I woulda held her at gunpoint and made a citizen's arrest. WTF
"I am waiting for such incident to happen to me so that I can beat the shit out of her, and of course it will be all revenge."
"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_2S6eyJLk-/ https://i.redd.it/lsdqvw9yv3x41.jpg This seems to be a focused attack on young naive boys and girls by some vested interests. If Indian govt. is really interested, they should check the root cause behind all this. This happened in news with a weeks time and a boy already suicide, some of them are <15yr olds. > Meanwhile, a new angle to the controversy has also come out on social media. One of the women who had initially outed the group has had her old conversations leaked which show her sexualising men and using homophobic and misogynistic language. > Social media users have been using the term Girls Locker Room to discuss how deeply embedded the problem is. The male chat group which did it is demonized and one boy is already arrested, 20 identified. https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/boislockerroom-delhi-schoolboy-taken-into-custody-by-police-over-students-instagram-group-chat-that-talked-about-rape-of-schoolgirls-2223358?pfrom=home-topstories The whole thing looks like a power play by women groups with vested interests. Otherwise, it is difficult for both these groups to be exposed at same time. As usual they will give girls a pussypass and cage the boys as a shamefully toxic display of women power. A young boy's life lost because of fake activism, all those feminist useless celebrities who took up the whining have blood on their hands."
I pity the kid who literally can't get away from the fact that his mom is a thot. Even if your family moves to another state your classmates might already recognize her the day you move in.
Look how attentive the future thot behind him is....she is seeing opportunity for what potential she has.
Happy ~~E-Thot's~~ Mother's day!
"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls** Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace. **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.** Note I say they are hoping you find them. Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins. You have to do the work. I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women. So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working. What we do as men isnt easy. When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.) My primary slave girl is a doctor. When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision. If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu. If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.* And I do. **Gaming Submissive Girls** Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun. Try on some light teasing. **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.** Many a truth was first spoken in jest. You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express. Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved. If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.* Then STFU. If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men? Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?* If she says and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.* Then change the topic. You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy. Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work. I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with. I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny. It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc. you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.* *But Uncle Vasya! Isnt that SEXIST?!* Well, yes it is, but thats the point. Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc. so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!* or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""* That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. **Chatting Her Up.** **Kino is Key.** Physicalize things early. Do not underestimate the power or touch. One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug. Sometimes I will do this with one arm. I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.* You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.* A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs. Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs. She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.* **Display dominance.** If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is. By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}. Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1 If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No. I am the man, and you are the girl. I will plan the date.*^2 Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!* Its a relief to them. There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want. I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww! That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags. They shame men for doing Masculine Things. Should those asshats be making up rules for you? Fuck^NO! You wanna know what that line results in most often? Pretty underwear. That I get to see. And remove. Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.* Fair point to her. It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole! How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!* Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you. As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.* The guys then reach out to me for advice *What should I say?!* the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure. Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do. Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation. **The Coup De Grace** If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her. If its public, I might whisper it in her ear: *I know your secret.* Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin. Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*. How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!* Give her a sly look and say, *You know, your secret.* She will continue to try to pry it out of you. Say, *You know. The one you have tried to hide all of your life.* Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.* {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.} I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew. Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3 Another typical reply, *I am a hunter. I know my prey.* That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss. Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements. Thats perfectly fine. Im not trying to force a bad fit. Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)** I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want. Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want. One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool. I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl. The key to that is abundance. I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl. I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into? I simply give them what they want. And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.* **Takeaways** -Submissive girls are fun. -Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours. Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive. -Not every girl is going to walk this path. Release those back into the wild. -With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).** -Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)** ^1 In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow. Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue. ^2 Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever). Dont over plan. ^3 Mild condescension is ok. Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about. Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid. Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet."

"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls** Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace. **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.** Note I say they are hoping you find them. Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins. You have to do the work. I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women. So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working. What we do as men isnt easy. When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.) My primary slave girl is a doctor. When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision. If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu. If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.* And I do. **Gaming Submissive Girls** Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun. Try on some light teasing. **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.** Many a truth was first spoken in jest. You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express. Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved. If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.* Then STFU. If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men? Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?* If she says and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.* Then change the topic. You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy. Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work. I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with. I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny. It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc. you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.* *But Uncle Vasya! Isnt that SEXIST?!* Well, yes it is, but thats the point. Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc. so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!* or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""* That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. **Chatting Her Up.** **Kino is Key.** Physicalize things early. Do not underestimate the power or touch. One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug. Sometimes I will do this with one arm. I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.* You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.* A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs. Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs. She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.* **Display dominance.** If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is. By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}. Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1 If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No. I am the man, and you are the girl. I will plan the date.*^2 Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!* Its a relief to them. There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want. I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww! That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags. They shame men for doing Masculine Things. Should those asshats be making up rules for you? Fuck^NO! You wanna know what that line results in most often? Pretty underwear. That I get to see. And remove. Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.* Fair point to her. It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole! How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!* Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you. As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.* The guys then reach out to me for advice *What should I say?!* the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure. Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do. Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation. **The Coup De Grace** If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her. If its public, I might whisper it in her ear: *I know your secret.* Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin. Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*. How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!* Give her a sly look and say, *You know, your secret.* She will continue to try to pry it out of you. Say, *You know. The one you have tried to hide all of your life.* Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.* {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.} I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew. Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3 Another typical reply, *I am a hunter. I know my prey.* That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss. Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.

So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working. What we do as men isnt easy. When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.) My primary slave girl is a doctor. When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision. If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu. If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.* And I do. **Gaming Submissive Girls** Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun. Try on some light teasing. **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.** Many a truth was first spoken in jest. You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express. Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved. If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.* Then STFU. If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men? Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?* If she says and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.* Then change the topic. You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy. Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work. I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with. I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny. It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc. you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.* *But Uncle Vasya! Isnt that SEXIST?!* Well, yes it is, but thats the point. Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc. so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!* or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""* That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. **Chatting Her Up.** **Kino is Key.** Physicalize things early. Do not underestimate the power or touch. One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug. Sometimes I will do this with one arm. I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.* You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.* A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs. Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs. She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.* **Display dominance.** If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is. By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}. Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1 If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No. I am the man, and you are the girl. I will plan the date.*^2 Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!* Its a relief to them. There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want. I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww! That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags. They shame men for doing Masculine Things. Should those asshats be making up rules for you? Fuck^NO! You wanna know what that line results in most often? Pretty underwear. That I get to see. And remove. Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.* Fair point to her. It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole! How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!* Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you. As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.* The guys then reach out to me for advice *What should I say?!* the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure. Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do. Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation. **The Coup De Grace** If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her. If its public, I might whisper it in her ear: *I know your secret.* Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin. Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*. How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!* Give her a sly look and say, *You know, your secret.* She will continue to try to pry it out of you. Say, *You know. The one you have tried to hide all of your life.* Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.* {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.} I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew. Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3 Another typical reply, *I am a hunter. I know my prey.* That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss. Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements. Thats perfectly fine. Im not trying to force a bad fit. Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)** I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want. Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want. One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool. I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl. The key to that is abundance. I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl. I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into? I simply give them what they want. And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.* **Takeaways** -Submissive girls are fun. -Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours. Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive. -Not every girl is going to walk this path. Release those back into the wild. -With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).** -Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)** ^1 In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow. Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue. ^2 Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever). Dont over plan. ^3 Mild condescension is ok. Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about. Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid. Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet."
"Had my first date in 3 months. Accidentally blew my load in a minute - Can this be salvaged?Well boys - Have I got a story for y'all. I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, or how to play this moving forward. Like many of you, I've been in quarantine for the past 2 months. Finally, in the last 2 weeks, I decided to say fuck it and download Tinder again. Before that, I was doing some solid self-introspection, reading, home workouts, learning to trade options, no drinking, no weed, lots of meditation. All was well. I was feeling great! During this time, I also stayed away from Porn and only jacked it once a week to no porn. Fast forward to yesterday and I had my first outside date with a bird in that span of time. Super fucking cute, short Asian girl with amazing tits. I took her to my usual spot, which is this outdoor walking street with cafes and whatnot. We grab some cold drinks and start working around the area. All was going phenomenal with exceptional banter, kino, easy-flowing conversation, etc. I said let's get outta here and we headed back to my place to 'watch a documentary' as that's what it said she liked to do in her profile. We hung out on the couch, more kino, kissing, slowing escalating, she's getting wet and ready to go. It's getting to the point where she has to go home, but I take is LMR and just keep escalating. Eventually, her dress on the floor and those gorgeous fucking tits are flopping around in my face. We're both naked and eventually, I caveman carry her to my bed. We're still working up to sex, which is fine, so I flip her around and we start 69'ing. Well here's where it all went to hell! After 2 months of quarantine, and not even having the chance to touch a bird, I fucking let myself accidentally get way over-excited, and as she's giving me the best head this side of 6 months - using her mouth in ways only god knows - before you know it I'm shooting a giant premature fucking load in her mouth. I lasted maybe a minute. Not my proudest minute at that. I had no problem when she was jacking me off vigorously, but as soon as she went down on me, while I'm eating her out, I fucking lost it. I haven't cum this fast in years. To make matters worse, she jumps up and runs to the bathroom to spit out my spunk, just leaving me sitting there on the bed. I mean, maybe she was surprised at my load, maybe I fucking hit the back of her throat. I don't fucking know. She comes back out of the bathroom, and I try to play it off as if I'm just gonna finish her. I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home - it's 11:30 pm and she has to wake up at 7 am. I say cool and here's where she proceeds to give me the ego dick punch of death. ""Oh - you came so fast"" in what can only be described as a disappointing tone. I wasn't quick enough on my feet to come up with a good line, but I also didn't fucking show emotion either. I just played it off to quarantine and not having any action in a while. Just like it was no big deal, and just hoping it was a shit-test. So many other things I could have said, trust me I know. But the damage was done and my ego lay in tiny fucking shards all over the floor. So boys - what do you think? Any chance of salvaging this. I feel like there's no fucking way I'm gonna contact her now. Gonna just have to wait for her. And if she does contact, I'll just never bring it up again like it never even happened. Again - every other part of the date was great. I actually enjoyed conversing with her. That is the first time in a while. Thing is, I've got 3 more dates lined up with 3 different birds this week alone, but I'll be dammed if my ego won't let me forget this performance. Of course, I want the revenge fuck now to show her what I can really do in bed. What do you think lads? **Edit #1**: She literally just reached out asking for some innocuous link to another documentary I had mentioned. If she really wanted to ghost, she wouldn't have contacted at all, I think. **Edit #2:** Lads, you're all legends! Cheers for the solid advice from all of you. I truly appreciate it. Some hard lessons to learn, but that's all part of the process. As a consensus: DGAF Attitude, Amused Mastery, Ego is the Enemy, Better Psychological Stimulation, and Eat that Pussy Better are the lessons learned. Just been a little outta practice. Quarantine does weird shit to the social skills. But it will all come back. On to the next one!"
"1. If this is a recorded statement, then it should be used in the court. 2. If the judge allows or agrees such a statement, then abetment to suicide is no more a crime. 3. This can be now used in a lot of cases of one persuading another to a crime. If X keeps on telling Y to kill themselves or kill somebody else and this case was brought to court, then X can easily get off by saying ""If Y can't handle the pressure, it's not my fault"". Hired assassins and mercenaries will have a field day. The danger of having a society and a constitution that bends to women is that it incentivises the women to be entitled, callous and evil."

"IMO, it's the lack of fathers. We live in an increasingly male disposable world. There's a very large swath of women that are very vocal about the optionality of fathers. Combine this with the lack of male role models in school (outside of an occasional teacher/coach), and we begin to see how they don't value men."
"The ACLU has become nothing more than a group lobbying for intersectional woke ideology. It doesn't even support civil liberties any more... due process is, after all, a vital civil liberty. As *Reason Online* writes about this subject, ""the lawsuit frequently asserts that marginalized students will suffer under the new rules, but it never acknowledges that students of color were disproportionately harmed by the old rules. *White woman accuses black man of rape; black man is expelled* was a distressingly common series of events under the old regime."" (see https://reason.com/2020/05/15/aclu-betsy-devos-title-ix-rule-due-process/). I guess this proves that white women are *de facto* ranked higher than black men on the progressive stack... which wouldn't surprise me given white women are a larger proportion of intersectional leftists. Henceforth the ACLU has lost any moral credibility whatsoever."
"The TRP / Black Pill / Incel mindset has given me sever body image issuesIve been going bald since I was 17 and it has ruined my self esteem. I have been with a lot of women, both hookups and relationships but I never believe they are actually attracted to me. I always rationalize the attraction in an Incel way. Whenever I see couples in public I assume the woman isn't actually attracted to the man unless hes conventionally attractive. In my mind, women have a dual mating strategy. Either the guy is hot and the girls passionately desire him in a lustful, sexual way, or he is not and the woman tolerates the way he looks and is with him for money, status, or personality traits. How do I stop thinking like this?"
"The sad truth is that a man is only valued by his actions, whereas a woman is valued by her looks/body, something that is inherent to her."

"A weapon being used on your mind -- And what you can doDiscussed in greater detail in [my video](https://youtu.be/By8cgQaii5E). Today's generations have something no other did before. Previous generations had access to it but it was much simpler and less damaging if abused. And you likely had to go somewhere in person to acquire it which in itself might have prevented you for fear of embarrassment. Access to porn and what is available has become too powerful. I remember growing up in the 90's. My friends and I stumbled upon a magazine stash at a nearby construction site. We thought we had just found gold. We each took one of the magazines home.. and guarded it like the One True Ring. Fast forward a few years later and those same friends and I are trading floppy disks that could hold a few pictures or maybe 1-2 video clips of 3 or 4 seconds. Then a few years later broadband internet starting coming out and was available in my neighborhoods. Back then we called it ""cable internet."" File sharing programs were popular for downloading MP3s but they were also gigantic repositories for adult material. You could type in a search string and click download all. A few hours later you'd have tons and tons of video material. Then the streaming sites came and we have today's version of modern porn access. I realize many of you might not have a problem with porn. I myself have been able to suppress my use of it. But we are here to help other men. A lot of the guys that read this site are young and might be struggling with this. I used to struggle before I knew I was struggling with it. At this point I believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world. Think about it. There is a reason why Russia and China both have laws banning the production of it. These are our rivals... and they must be laughing knowing Americans and Westerners are mostly subdued by this degeneracy. Blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis. As someone who has used Porn while in an LTR and then stopped using it there is a big difference in sexual pleasure once you abstain. Death Grip is real and makes real sex less pleasurable. Once you beat death grip sex will feel like losing your virginity every time. If you're not whacking it often you won't be suffering from death grip but it is real for those whacking it on a nightly basis. And for those who think approaching women is not worth it... That's likely your opinion because you have an outlet for your desires. Take that outlet away and your sexual drive will take off like a rocket ship and you will inevitably become good at cold-approach because you will have no other choice. There is no shame in admitting you might have a problem and there are tools that can help. Porn blocking tools exist and work in multiple ways. Of course they can't stop you on every single device you own so you'll need some discipline. The NoFap community on this website and other places is also very helpful for support and questions. Other men will literally jump in a cold shower in the first few days of abstaining if they must. There is no shame if you have been a victim of this. Again, not all of you will be in this position. You might be enjoying a good porn-laced whack every now and then and that's fine. And some of you might already know that you can whack it without porn entirely and its much healthier for you. I'm definitely not advocating for pure noFap forever. Just don't let it get out of control. Build your power and testosterone by keeping it in your balls for a week or so before release if you're by yourself. And remember, dating use app is on the rise even on lock-down. Women are horny and alone and want a man to get in bed with them regardless of the local rules of social-distance in place. Lessons learned: \-My opinion on Porn is that it is a tool used by rival governments to hurt the men of The West. \-Death grip is real and comes from nightly porn use. It will prevent you from feeling maximum pleasure when having sex. \-Daily use of Porn is hurting your motivation to speak to women and form relationships. \-Tools exist to prevent or curb porn use and there are other methods you can do to help in the form of distracting yourself. &#x200B; Sources: Porn laws by country -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography\_laws\_by\_region Porn Blockers -- https://listoffreeware.com/free-porn-blocker-software-windows/ Tinder use is way up! -- https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/tinder-surpasses-bumble-okcupid-hinge-in-coronavirus-lockdown"

"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.** Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. **This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.** I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce. The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut. Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9 *y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!* This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit. I want you to catch STDs, not court cases. Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too. A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation... **Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.** The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.** Takeaways - Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. - HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT - Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it. - Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. - Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved."

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.** Takeaways - Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. - HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT - Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it. - Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. - Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved."
"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.** Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. **This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.** I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce. The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut. Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9 *y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!* This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit. I want you to catch STDs, not court cases. Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too. A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation... **Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.** The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line.""

Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit. I want you to catch STDs, not court cases. Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too. A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation... **Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.** The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.** Takeaways - Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. - HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT - Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it. - Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. - Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved."
"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.** Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. **This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.** I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce. The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

If I See ONE More Goddamn Becky or Stacylite Complaining on Here...The amount of Beckies/Stacylites I see on this sub [MAKES ME SICK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8UnlsUGsIU) I now feel obligated to look at someone's history before I upvote or reply because I refuse to acknowledge obnoxious attention-whoring normies. Every single time I click on one of their profiles I'm greeted with 700 selfies on various subs. Huh? If you seriously believed you were ugly you wouldn't post your pics all over Reddit. Like what in the goddamn fuck are all of you complaining about? I literally don't get it. Are you just mad that you're not a gigastacy with 100k+ ig followers? Feeling like you have the right to bitch about your normal ass life to a bunch of people who are actually struggling is just gross and condescending. Stop it. Now. These people need to get banned.

"Yeah, I don't know that someone posting that many selfies online constitutes as someone with high self esteem. From what I have observed, it usually means quite the opposite. People's low self esteem can manifest in different ways. Some may show this by not wanting to take or show pictures of themselves. Others may post pictures for the sole purpose of getting people to ""like"" it and compliment them. No one with high self esteem would need that much attention from people. Both cases indicate someone with low self esteem in my opinion. I knew a handful of girls in highschool who had a lot of instagram followers and what not yet they had horrible self esteem for whatever reason. Not getting enough likes on a picture would cause them to delete it. Please keep in mind that just because YOU view someone as a normie or a becky or whatever does not mean that other people do or that the person you are referring to even thinks they are."
"yeah, if i had to guess youre probably right. they're just upset they dont get every single thing handed to them like stacy. imo it's just as annoying as the normie inkwells that bitch and whine about female hypergamy because they cant accept that stacy is way out of their league and doesnt want them. i have only seen one femcel ever post her face, and poor girl was young and definitely severely mentally ill. the comments ripped her apart joking about how ugly she was (this was in r/theglowup btw). real femcels dont post their face."

He's doing gods work and THOTS are losing their minds.
"300cc of VALIDATION cures anything these days for them. But, then it's funny when they feel super bad about it and then get depressed for being an internet whore and then do it again. Such a vicious catch 22."
"It's pretty satisfying. Girl told me she ""wanted to slow things down"" but still continue to see each other. (we were just FWB's at the time. Nothing more. It was simply an effort by her to make a power-grab) I just agreed in the moment and then blew her off for about a month. Let the hamster run in its little wheel. Then, a month after the conversation she came back literally begging to hook up again. Got to straight up tell her no. So satisfying knowing that whole month she was dying for validation."

Im suicidal because im a disgusting dirty and gross whore. Im only aroused sexually by beautiful men. No matter where I talk about this I get banned or silenced because its that pathetic and gross. My last post got removed by a moderator and I was told I didnt seem suicidal enough. Im a cutter and i one time have to have 100 stitches at the hospital in my left arm. For anyone who doesnt think im suicidal enough or serious i have razors i can take pictures of to prove that i am. You are welcome to message me about it.

A lot of men keep telling me that most women are able to be aroused by ugly men so long as those men say & do the right things. I am not this way though. I just like beauty. My question is: is this how most women are? Ive been trying to talk about this on various subreddits and getting banned.

I ask because I got banned from [r/askwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/) for asking about my sexuality & *if it was normal for women to love beauty*.

"Father died, girlfriend left me shortly afterMy dad succumbed to Covid-19; my girlfriend was with me for about a week until the grief set in and I started getting really emotional (rage/depression). I hate the reality that we have to objectify women as these incapable pieces of meat. Like, why cant my girlfriend sympathizewhy do I, after even losing my father, have to maintain this stoicism. Im fucking entitled to some emotion, im a real fucking human being. TRP philosophy breeds success; would really appreciate some advice from the community on dealing with this grief and the deriving emotions caused by the breakup."
"1. Who cares about this worthless bitch. Consign her to the trash and shes easily replaceable. 2. Sorry to hear about your dad. Yes, you have to get on with it as when one of us falls, another man must pick up his burden. But there will be real pain and grief, and youll have to find a way to deal with that. Take as long as you need, and focus on rebuilding your life and supporting your family emotionally. About the girl: good riddance."

"Life is relentless and unforgiving. You have to roll with it. She, however, has shown herself to be a true piece of trash. Sucks, yes, but if you choose to take her back when her dumb ass comes crawling back (it does happen when the person they thought was better isn't), you'll deserve your fate. Be glad she's gone."
"I'm sorry for your loss. A father is irreplaceable. As for the woman, as cold as this may sound, I'm not surprised. Women can't handle deep emotions from a man because of their biological hardwiring and childish mental capacity. To most women, seeing a man at his worst is repulsive. Kick her to the curb, move on, and take this lesson and experience with you. &#x200B; Godspeed. I want to hear about your progress one day."
FUCK THAT BITCH. Sorry about your dad.
FUCK THAT BITCH. Sorry about your dad.
"Waste of money. Cars, like height, are a looks multiplier. If a girl is attracted to you, a cool car or good height might make her more attracted to you. A lot of guys delude themselves into thinking having a cool car or whatever will make them a hit with women. But even bluepilled ""shower more"" women aren't claiming you should carmaxx. Besides, Chad could drive a 1994 Grand Am, and Stacy will just think he's sensible."
"Ya i try to do that. I usually just smirk and move on talk to someone else. He keeps doing it tho, i wonder what other people think of me when i ignore him if they understand or if they think im a pussy."

"Red Pill Rage makes you look petty.**Introduction** I recently had a young man send me a text saying how he is mad at the world, how women are a waste of time, F this F that. He lost his cool. As someone who is older than him and as someone he looks up to, I feel like I am personally responsible for not handling this. So I sat him down for a talk, to explain what he is going through. Red Pill Rage. **Body** This is a phase that many men go through after realizing how this world operates. We were once blue pilled simps who were shown the light (or found it/were driven to it). We are now in recovery mode to become who we were biologically born to be. This is a life long process, its slow, but if you are consistent, it will be steady up and up. It's the school of life. You will study, pass, and fail. Its normal. Someone going through red pill rage will exhibit symptoms including but not limited to: * Anger and disdain for women * Anger and disdain for the people who raised him * Depression and lack of motivation to proceed in the world * Confusion as to what to do next. The sidebar covers pretty much all the fundamentals that we must go out and practice through execution, but it is not a play by play. It is not a step by step instruction manual on what to do, and this is what frustrates people going through rage even more. And the younger and less based the person is, the worse and chaotic his rage will be. Let me explain why. The blue pilled betas can actually teach us something. Their life's goal is to succeed in this world. Have a ""stable"" career, have ""retirement"" savings, have a ""normal"" family, raise ""normal"" kids, etc. They want that blue pilled life dream, even if they have to work their ass off for it. They are WILLING (even if brainwashed) into giving up their lives to build this ""stable"" world around them. Sure there are always exceptions to this rule, but at least the more traditional men, will be chasing a stable career in medicine or engineering or something. This makes them at least well based in their own life. Even if they go through a divorce and realize how blue pilled they are, red pill rage will last a shorter amount of time for them, because they already have a financial and educational foundation. They have a resume, they just have to start their social/sexual life over, which, thanks to the sidebar, is as simple as going out into the real world and fucking up repeatedly until you get the hang of it (not really but you get the gist). A young man in his late teens or early college years who finds the red pill, and realizes why his young sexual life is absolute garbage, will have severe rage. This is because he has no existing foundation. He hasn't had a marriage/relationship that is long enough to give him some experience. He doesn't have the finances to be able to just move to a new city and start over. He doesn't have a ""successful"" resume. He goes into full panic mode, and eventually, just gives up. He knows he needs to get his shit together, but on top of his obligations to get his financial and practical life together, he is now bombarded with information on how to fix his still not fully developed sexual life. Again, there are plenty of exceptions to the rules. I have seen young men who found the red pill and immediately saw the mountain they must climb and proceeded to hatch multiple plans on how to do so. Others...fell into depression cursing the world they live in and becoming more reliant on spoon fed step by step instructions on how to proceed. This dependence on a play by play must be broken. So here I will leave some recommendations as to what to do if you find yourself in this situation. This is not a step by step instruction booklet. These are tips that will explain what you are feeling, why, and where to go. 1. You are mad at women for being the way they are. Okay, and? Screw them. Focus on yourself and your individual happiness and satisfaction (in moderation) as well as making sure you have a solid foundation financially and educationally. 2. ""Everything we do is just to get laid, what is the point?!"" This is where you need to change your mindset. Getting laid is a PERK of having a solid foundation as a MAN. Be a man first, slay pussy later. You need to understand that you do not revolve around women, they revolve around you. You must become a magnet, not be attracted to one. A magnet has scientific properties that make it attract all sorts of metals. IRL this is: Money, fame, good looks, reputation, success, status, masculine alpha behavior/mentality, an IDGAF mentality for sure. Magnets do not fucking care what you are, if you're within range, you will be attracted. 3. You feel like you know more than the men around you so now you are acting petty and posting on your instagram story about how ""women suck and man up and etc"". Stop. Just stop. You are just like everyone else, we are just like you. We are all in the same boat, you are not special, and just because you know something someone else doesn't, doesn't mean you are better. Also, stop putting red pill stuff you read online on your instabooks, you will alienate anyone who sees it. Just get off social media period, stop texting women and being their little bitch, go to #1 on this list, go make your base. No not a pillow fort. A base, somewhere you live, somewhere you can go to when shit hits the fan and start over. **Conclusion** Remember at least one thing from all of this: This is not an over night change. This will take years. Just like the gym wont turn you into the rock over night, reading trp content and practicing it wont make you an alpha over night. I know I am far from where I want to be, but I want to try, and I will try. So go cool off from the rage, accept the world as it is, and learn to use it to your advantage."
"The anger is part of the acceptance process though innit? Although I agree that you cant be mad forever. Women are women, and theyre going to women. No point in hating them for it, best to understand why they do what they do, then exploit that knowledge for your own gain. Dont hate a sloot just cause shes a sloot. If youre not gonna fuck her, why do you care? The only guys that stay mad forever are the ones that dream about getting married. Depending on what country youre from thats akin to financial suicide, and for some thats a tough pill to swallow."

"If I were the boys father Id release a short statement: >In a heated exchange with a Ms Clementine Ford online who on previous occasions has called for all men to be killed and said Have you killed a man today, and if not; why not? I understand that my teenage son responded said that the author should first use a shotgun to kill herself. > On behalf of my son, and in light of the fact that XXX, all men, end their lives with a firearm each year, Id like to apologize for this crude and offensive language; not just to Miss Ford, but particularly to the many Australian families left in grief by suicide each year. Edit: If it was *me* Id laugh and tell the man-hating twat to suck my hairy balls, but Im old enough to handle it."

"Guy at my LTRs job is trying fuck herMy LTR of 18 months called me this morning saying she feels guilty. A guy she works with has been flirting with her. She said, she felt bad because she didnt completely negate his sexual behavior and briefly entertained the idea at the time. She has brought him up to me before and she considered him to be one of the few people at work that she could be friendly with, since the place is loaded with overweight, snarky Karens. I asked her if she did anything with him and she said no, which I do believe right now. Shes been working at this place for about 3 months and she told me about the guy from the beginning. I sensed it would come to this at some point. I laughed it off and told her oh that must be your work husband. She also told me hes kinda fat and that Im much better looking. If hes working as a nurse, I also know Im more financially stable than him. The guy does know about me and yet he continues to pursue my girl. This man has an LTR and a child which he lives with. He told her that his girlfriend would be cool with it if they had a thing on the side and that his gf is also bisexual. I dont know how she responded to him because I didnt take it too seriously when she brought it up. When she told me about it, I said I appreciate your honesty and Im not gonna hold it against you. Is this guy texting you? She said; no he doesnt have my number. Then I said, Ive seen the type of guys that hit on you and Im not worried about any of them lol. She laughed and got slightly offended. My LTR is definitely the type to crave male attention from what I can see and Im sure she was flattered by the fact that this guy pushed up on her. My question is, am I going to have to demote this girl to a plate eventually? Is this a major red flag? Whats the likelihood she ends up fucking this dude? Do I have to go down to her job and fight this dude? Ive been way too available to this woman for the past 4-5 months. Taking every phone call on her break and spending all my free time with her. Should I start ignoring her calls and distancing myself from her more? I just setup some dating apps and Im beginning to cultivate new leads on girls. Am I overreacting to this whole thing? What do you guys think I should do?"
"I would say you have three possible options. Rookie, intermediate, and advanced. Which option you choose is strictly up to your level of confidence. Rookie: pick her up from work and when you see the guy, just give him a stare. Say nothing. Give him a handshake and crush his hand during the handshake. Say ""is this the fat faggot you were telling me about?"" This path is a little insecure but if fatty is a pussy he will fuck off Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat. If she is jealous of other girls than she will be nervous and trying to please you. What do you think?"

"If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen. You're insecure and you need to fix that primarily. 1. You should have already been cultivating multiple women in the first place. 2. She may monkey branch, and that's just life. Get more chicks and realize that she's not yours, it's just your turn."
">I love beating women. I like to hear them scream while I leave them to die in my basement Wow OP, just wow."
"I think that a lot women are held to a higher standard than men on somethings : -parenting -infidelitys -abortion -abandonment -cooking -cleaning That when they fail it seems worse than mans failures. I guy I used to know abandoned his kids for 5 year but got pats in the back for calling his kids on their bday but when she(the wife) divorced him and told the truth about what happened she was a bitch . So many men I know rely on their SO so much for basic needs cleaning/cooking that when they put away the dishes or vacuum the floor their heroes or deserve something. Men can walk away from their kids but if a women gives them up for adoption/abortion she a monster. Men can get away with changing their kids diapers once but god forbid a women hires a nanny or housekeeper. Single mother are shunned and laughed at but single fathers are heroes. I could go on and on about this BUT heres the point WE as WOMEN, MOTHERS, TEACHERS and FRIENDS need to set the bar higher and train both men and women to cook, clean, take responsibility, to be an active parent and not allow boys to be boys."
"Seriously, though. It *does* seem like they are offended by the existence of female human beings. That it's not about all the moronic traits they claim women possess (that all women are whores, don't want men shorter than X, etc etc etc), but that the problem is *women* themselves. That they exist. But, as you say, at the same time they base their whole identity on the notion that ""we want women, but women doesn't want us"". It's just honestly so incredibly confusing."
Because they cant think of doing anything unless they are rewarded with sex. They honestly believe anything that a person has ever done is directly tied to getting their dick wet. Heart surgeon is thinking about how much pussy he is going to get while completing a quadruple bypass. Charity worker giving food to the homeless...obviously trying to pick up.
">but we as men fuck it up for them. Agreed. It's amusing how many men don't ask out pretty girls because ""there's no way she'll go out with me."" Maybe, maybe not. Take things as far as you can and let *her* be the one to stop you. Don't stop yourself dumb dumb. >We do this by judging girls and calling them sluts if they sleep around This one gets me too. So many guys try to sleep with pretty girls, and then when they don't, they'll get pissed and call em hoes or sluts or whatever. If you want girls to hookup with you, then why are you shaming them for hooking up? >the frame of curiosity. This is a good frame, especially in the form of ""I wonder if she's into guys like me?"" Then go find out. Overall, good post."

Do you guys really call women sluts?
"I always found slut shaming to be sarcastic to some degree, sex is a pretty normal thing biologically speaking. I also feel like it's somewhat easier to pull older women because of this whole ""slut"" concept. U might have to brush up on ur game, but middle aged woman are much more willing to sleep around than younger women because they simply dont give a fuck about being labeled"

"Do you hate the word THOT as much as I do?Definitions vary on the internet- Google: a woman who has many casual sexual encounters or relationships. Urban Dic: A woman who pretends to be the type of valuable female commodity who rightfully earns male commitmentuntil the man discovers that shes just a cheap imitation of a good girl who is good only for mindless sex, not relationships or respect. Urban Dic: 'That Ho Over There' [dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com): A*thot* is a woman that pretends to be classy and sexy but is actually cheap and easy (i.e., slutty).As it spread online, the term came to insult any woman whos seen as bitchy and attention-seeking."
Yes. Its another sexist slur like the word slut. Men are called a player but women get called a slut.

"Bitch and 'bitchy' are definitely gender-related insults, and at least that one *is* sexist. That said, because of its prevelance, it's not uncommon for women to worry (especially in circumstances where they are being assertive) about seeming 'bitchy'-- that's how we know that bitch and bitchiness is 1) negative and 2) something women want to avoid. Some women embrace and are trying to reclaim bitch (being a 'Boss Ass Bitch' is very positive, for instance)-- personally I try to avoid using the term. I feel like it's derogatory and I don't have much interest in reclaiming it."
">Thing is, during that time, that month, i had a gut feeling something wasn't connecting... So big lesson is, your gut feeling is almost never wrong. Always. >One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. Gentlemen.... understand this. A woman who is cheating will lie and deny better than any man who gets accused of lying. The tears come on. The ""how can you not trust me"" lines come out. They will act offended, upset, hurt, etc., that you could accuse them of something so horrible. And the kicker... they say this with HIS cum still on her breath. I lived this shit. It's amazing how far women will carry the betrayal. Lies. Trickle truths. Gaslighting. Manipulation. >Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation... I had to do that once. When she was in the ""nothing happened"" stage, she showed me edited screenshots, where she deleted PARTS of the conversation. The conversation made it look like it was all him. Years later, I found the REAL screenshots in her email. She saved the full conversation for herself before editing the conversation for me to see. Cheaters will deny everything until faced with facts IN WRITING or IN VIDEO or IN PICTURES. >I am quite happy with this breakup, because man, i have been wanting out, i just needed a legitimate reason for leaving now i finally caught the bitch. Your main point of weakness. You wanted to leave her anyway, but waited for a reason. ""Because I feel like it"" is a reason. Work on this area. Glad you nexted her. Many guys these days would be asking TRP what to do next."

"You're on the right path. >Count me out in exclusive dating, this bitches got none to offer other than pussy Yes she cheated on you. However as a man you must take responsibility for not vetting properly, and also attempting LTR in a hyper-sexualised environment like college. Dont let this girl propel you into some kind of anger phase"

"It seems like you're taking on the masculine role since you're the one saving the guy when its usually the other way around. I looked at your recent comment history and it seems like you are redpilled about the reality of men and how messed up and unfair expectations of women in relationships can be. You wouldn't sacrifice yourself in a relationship like you would in your fantasies. Super interesting. When our fantasies contradict with our real life views on things drastically it's a sign of inner conflicts within us. There are so many reasons you are attached to this fantasy. It makes you feel righteous. It makes you seem very noble and brave. You might like to play this role of protector for your crush because it gives you control over him. He needs you to survive. He is probably in awe of you. There could some narcissism involved. The fact that you're watching over him even after you've passed on can again show a desire for more control over him. And by being able to watch over him like this it's kind of a way to still be with him. Also this way you also avoid the pressures of being in a relationship with him if you somehow saved him without having to sacrifice yourself and he fell in love with you. If you were in a real relationship with him you would have to rely on who you are in your day to day life to keep him interested and not this super woman role and that could be anxiety inducing and it's less exciting and dramatic. That's why you don't like imagining you two together in a normal relationship. Because then you would become more vulnerable. It also seems like what you want is beyond love. You might not have earned his love but you got his respect. In the end you are unattainable to him even if he wanted to be with you he can't. There's no way he could ever pay you back when you're gone. He will probably think about you in a higher way than his gf. In a pure way you prefer. He might love you in a deeper way than he loves her because you saved him. She could never do that for him. You probably imagine her as being some basic Stacy while you are unique and extraordinary. It seems like you really hate the focus to ever be on looks and you only want a guy to like you for non sexual related reasons like your altruism and character, Not your looks. You feel degraded when a guy falls for your looks. You want to be loved for non shallow reasons. You might be sexually repressed. You might feel resentful and mistrustful of men in real life. So many desires and personality and character traits hidden within us come out in our fantasies. It could be that you resent the gender roles placed on women. Do you find yourself drawn to female characters who are very strong and defy their gender roles? Like Katniss Everdeen? She volunteered as tribute which can be seen as her sacrificing herself for her younger sister. Did you grow up with a misogynistic or abusive father? Was your father unromantic and ungentlemanlike towards your mother? Like he doesn't open doors for her or bring her surprise gifts? You never saw him show tenderness to her? or that he valued her for anything besides domestic duties? Was your mother a codependent who did so much for her husband but got no equal effort in return? and you would hate to be like her? Even if you would never act like a codependent in a real relationship with a guy. In your fantasy there's a lot of co dependent traits showing in your character. Her sacrificing herself for a guy she thinks will never be with her can be seen as masochistic and self defeating. She thinks she has to prove herself to this guy by saving him. She doesn't think she has a value outside of what she can do for someone which is what codependents believe. Her motivations are not actually pure. She wants to be praised and admired. She wants control over this guy. &#x200B; By contrast do you find yourself being somewhat drawn to and yet cringing at helpless and very weak female characters like Bella Swan from Twilight? But you would never admit to being drawn to twilight in real life because so much of Bella's appeal to the men who love her is because of her feminine traits. Like her scent and her looks and her clumsiness which makes them hyper vigilant in protecting her placing them in the hero role which makes them feel strong and masculine. She doesn't have to do much to keep them interested. Which you might hate and feel disgusted by. You want a guy to value you for things more than just your looks you want them to value you for being powerful and having virtuous characteristics. She doesn't have to save anyone. It's not her noble character that makes the guys go crazy. Do you feel empty and conflicted about love stories like Twilight? Do stories like Twilight make you feel so many different and mostly negative emotions but yet you feel drawn to it? Because at the end Bella got the guy without sacrificing herself for him. She didn't really do anything. She was just pretty and smelled good and got everything most people desire. Love, children, wealth, beauty, immorality and youth. Playing the conventionally masculine role means you switch the gender roles and you subconsciously might want to seem stronger than a guy because you have internalized misogyny. These fantasies are actually not unusual. Men have savior fantasies or hero fantasies and no one would be mocking you if you were a man saying this. Don't take it to heart what ignorant people think about this. The more you focus on how embarrassed you are the less you can dig deeper into understanding yourself. Deep down you might feel suppressed in many ways. You should explore that."
"Should I send my ex-boyfriends mom a thank you card? If so, how? Would love some help from the RP ladies!As I posted here before, I broke up with my semi-emotionally abusive ex for the final time, and Im determined to make it stick. While he rarely verbally assaulted me (sometimes would call me a bitch), he would constantly criticize me and tell me all the things about myself I needed to change. I made a list of everything he criticized me more than 3x about. There were 452 list items. One was touches lips to reusable water bottle, and another was wears pink coat that looks childish. He loves playing music and I do not (my mom tried to force me a lot as a kid and it literally makes me panic), and he got into an argument with me for over an hour, trying to make me play piano for/with him. I offered to do ballet (practiced for years as a kid) or write songs to it, but it was no good for him. He threw a tantrum over it once, and locked himself in his room for an hour. I told him I was sick of him degrading my self-esteem, and to find someone who better fit his needs. If youre wondering why I spent so much time with this guy, its because I have low self-esteem, and because it got especially bad over the last six months. In addition, my little brother developed schizophrenia in October, and he was even more critical of me about stupid things, and it was made worse because, rather than take or accept it, I would get really mad at him and sometimes criticize him back (which I never ever did before.) I know thats not RPW, but it would be things like this: In December, as my little brother got sicker and no medication helped, I began the grieving process. I was crying all the time. He offered to fill up a bath. Sounds nice, right? Well, I accidentally drained it and didnt notice because I was crying over my little brother losing his future (which had looked so bright), and he came up to yell at me and put me down for that. I ended up breaking down crying. So. Not a good relationship. Learned many things and am working on my self-esteem before I get into a new one, otherwise Ill just end up with the same kind of Bad Captain. I got home today and found two cards with gifts from his sister and mom. I knew they would send graduation gifts, so I bought each of them a $25 gift card to a coffee shop and a store they like, respectively, and sent it to them as a sweet gift. I had hoped that would be taken as a thank-you, but because they were so close to Mothers Day, Im not sure. Should I send them a thank you note? I want to be no contact with the guy, Im so serious about ending it, but I dont want to be rude. If so, how do I do it? More background: The mom and I had a close relationship (she was really excited about me getting married/becoming a mom and that I was with him), while the sister was more like him (shes a GREAT wife and mother, but is not very friendly/personable. She and him would sometimes put my down together.)"
"1. Whatever vibration you put out, you will attract A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners. Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play One of those factors, sadly, are looks. And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok. it can be used as a form of endearment. You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like. Also you might think youre a nice guy...but if youre posting here and believing some of these Ill written advices...youre probably not as nice of a guy as you think."
"1. Whatever vibration you put out, you will attract A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners. Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play One of those factors, sadly, are looks. And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok. it can be used as a form of endearment. You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like. Also you might think youre a nice guy...but if youre posting here and believing some of these Ill written advices...youre probably not as nice of a guy as you think."
">Please keep in mind that just because YOU view someone as a normie or a becky or whatever does not mean that other people do or that the person you are referring to even thinks they are. THINKING you're ugly is vastly different from actually BEING ugly. It doesn't matter that they may perceive themselves as ugly, we do not share the same experiences and they have no right to infiltrate one of the few spaces genuinely ugly people have. Ugly women in real life have no voice. Normies are committed to ensuring that we don't have a voice online either by stealing spaces meant for us, then having the AUDACITY to expect us to have sympathy for them because :( they're insecure :(. They should not be here and it's not my responsibility to coddle normal or attractive people with low self-esteem."
"Yes. I mean, given an example: Racist white women will always called out before racist white men This isn't to say that it's not warranted contempt for white women's racism, it's to point out the fact that we hold them far more accountable than we hold the male counterpoint. And, very often, men will use this as a sort of ""justified misogyny""-- hence white boys clinging to Karen and throwing it any woman who disagrees with them."
