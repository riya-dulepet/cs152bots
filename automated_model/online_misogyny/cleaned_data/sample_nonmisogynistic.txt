The only reason I had a happy high school experience as an ugly woman is because 1) the woman around me saw me as no competition (there was a great deal of grief over the few town bicycles) and 2) in general, the lack of sexual tension allowed us to relate to one another without feeling like we were competing for male favor. It's pretty awful. You know what those studies say - boys benefit from being around girls; boys are detrimental to girls' education in turn
Hi! I dont grow up in a super conservative household, but I guess thought I should answer anyway. My family is catholic, so theres that. But my parents never made me think sex was a bad thing. Weve always tried to look at it in a positive, healthy light. Except I think Im asexual too. So in my experience, although Ive grown up thinking sex was a natural thing, it hasnt changed my attitude towards sex, and me not wanting it or feeing sexual attraction. Also, you can still be heteromantic! Which means double dates and romantic things with a partner are still something you can do while being asexual. Sorry if this isnt written very well, its a reply on the go! Good luck and feel free to ask more questions
It do be pretty majestic!
This is excellent thank you!
The hot guys she goes after arent interested in settling down. She doesnt want the men who do want to get married.
Can't link directly because Twitter randos, but it's the same old story. Someone created a viral tweet mocking the artist, the SJdub then dogpiled the artist. The person who started it got pushback from normal people and then claimed victimhood on the grounds of immutable characteristics. Then BitC wrote about it. Edit: Original artist has not backed down or apologized. Her tweet is still up. https://twitter.com/SakimiChanArt/status/1152040832985436166?s=19 (NSFW)
Omg I need to try this
Paywall, but if we're looking at the numbers from this year, well, yeah. Because all our weddings were cancelled...

Perfect. Ill DM you
Lmao it's funny because the main character,Greg Heffley has a very incely personality. I loved these books as a kid,still do.
From recent changes I'd say -Geo +Gotcha and -Goga +Cryn were quite bad, whether they were the worst overall idk, they were the worst in the last 6 months for sure.
no.
> I shower twice a day Theres your problem. Not enough showers. Inkwells must shower at minimum 3 times a day, sometimes even 4 depending on how good your personality had been the day before.
Nah you aren't screwed, as long as you can get her out on another date, and go to somewhere more intimate so you are close together (rather than constantly being separated by a table etc) Honestly I think this detail gets overlooked but it's really effective
A guy once wrote a friend of mine my dick would look so good inside you I guess this is what he meant!
That's literally the point... haha
I tend to have trouble keeping my attention on games for long periods of time unless theyre online / multiplayer. But I played octopath on release for about 90 hours. Did all the side quests and everything. That never happens.
**OYS 40** Age 64 Ht 5'11" Wt 170 Wife 66 Married 43 Together 46 **Physical** I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy. **Mindset** After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various "victim" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long. **Relationship** Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and "gaming", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident. I had to consciously up the comfort, touch and praise. By Sunday it seemed like things were back to normal. And I'm taking my meditation time and practice with a renewed diligence.

Extremely go fuck yourself I know what you're talking about and there's a time to discuss it, but you are in the wrong place for this conversation considering everything she's gone through and still has to go through in the coming hours, days, weeks, .... years... dec.... Read the fucking room.
39???
That hurts my vagina and I dont even have a vagina
Agreed
Tact is an underrated skill which you lack. Being too aggressive makes you come off as desperate in situation 1. You pussied out in # 2. Timing makes a difference.
I do this too - or I wait a few days after seeing something I really like. If Im still thinking about it days after seeing it, then Ill allow myself to get it if its within my budget. I also try to visualise how itll fit in with my existing wardrobe. A few people I know have real issues with stress/ impulse online shopping, so this unsubscribing technique is a good behaviour retraining exercise for them. After doing this for a week so far I barley get anymore promotional/ sales emails. Some have been from shops I never shop at anyhow, so easy to let go of those
She reached out to you man, just go for it. Try snapping her funny things. I snapped this girl I've been talking to part of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgh0nSkIy04) from Cast Away with the caption "social distancing got me like" and it sparked a conversation. Feel free to use it if you want lol
LTR hits me with When are we getting married?Been seing this girl for almost a year exclusively, and before anyone asks why im in a relationship, well, I promoted her after plating 3 different ones. This is a keeper.. for now atleast. Shes always been keen on having me move in with her, asks around about serious stuff which Ive always just laughed off or avoided all together. However this morning she hits me with the When are we getting married? bomb. She had a grin on her face and had this false joke of a tone which instantly gave away that she was indeed 100% serious. Now, Im obviously laughing in my head and I couldnt possibly go down that road so I told her We can do it whenever you want, I just need to notify my other girlfriends and see if they are okay with me settling down. Afterwards I would just dodge the bullet, but I have a feeling shes always gonna be looking for my ultimate commitment both by moving in with her and ultimately marrying her, which I obviously have no intention of doing. Is there a way to keep these comfort tests fed without having to actually give in to such nonsense? Do I give her a false idea that I actually will marry her one day?
fuckboy
Comments on that tweet brings something very important: The "Guybrush paradox" (I refuse to call it a theory). Whereas Guybrush can be flawed, a sex-changed version Galbrush couldn't without copious amount of outrage. I say, that's true in the west. But I usually consume media from the east. (Japan, Korean and Chinese comics/shows). They are not affected by that issue at all. Take for example One Punch Man. You got a woman that's crazy OP in the top S ranks, and also a sister that acts as gatekeeper of lower ranks. They have different character traits, flaws and ideals. Or Shield Hero. You got high ranking nobles (in a matriarchy) abusing their powers, and at the same time others who aren't. You got average people and slaves. Men or womens, doesn't matter. And of it's been teased that enemies from their invasion waves have at their heads heroes which we have seen 4: a male samurai, a male reaper, a female arch mage, and a female dagger/fan user. Very varied female representarton all around. Or Bofuri. Main cast is mainly female. One of the rival guild has a female guildmaster who has no confidence in herself. Maple's a dim-witted idiot who'se habit of EATING the obstacles on her way somehow made her the most powerful being imaginable... But she's still a naive idiot under the Demon Lord appearance. In Soul Land (Korean manwha/show), there's a varied amount of males and females all different, with flaws and all, and the discrimination is based entirely on if they're humans or magical beasts, or class warfare. Womens are pretty powerful in that story. But if you would try those shows here, they would all be criticised for their depictions of womens. Because outrage scammers needs to scam so that their blackmail gives them another paycheck on their patreon.
If you ever hear someone say that, just tell them that standing to pee is a bad habit by default for men, it's not some privilege of ours and should be stopped. It's been proven that naturally we're built to pee standing, and it's way healthier for dudes.
If this is at a university you can always file a title IX complaint.
"Have you ever met a real life woman before?" I'm guessing the answer is not "Yes." And most women still shave their legs and pits. If you don't like women who choose not to conform to that particular requirement, you can look for one of the many more who do shave.

Looks like you're french and in SF. I am both of those things too. T'as l'air d'avoir ton game au point, mais si jamais t'as besoin d'un wingman ou de quelqu'un pour te hold accountable et te pousser approcher, c'est avec plaisir.
Women have rights, therefore I am a dour anime boy. Never before have I witnessed such succinct logic.
Agreed, how could this satire site get facts wrong??
Link?
Focus on who you want to be. What do you want to look like? What's your ideal life? Then break that down into the different areas - looks, athleticism, career, family. Start with looks - do you want grimey teeth and to weigh 130kg? No? Then brush your teeth twice a day and start weight loss. There are steps you can take for each one, you just need to focus on you and don't make it all about your virginity. PS Also fellow misophonia sufferer here and it's the absolute worst thing. It is almost impossible to describe to non-sufferers how it impacts your life. Happy to talk about it if you need any support.
Its called Hoop.
What kind of music do you listen to?I really enjoy Folk, Jazz, Bedroom Pop, Indie, R&B/Soul, Bluesy stuff. Ive always wondered if there is a certain kind of music that really suits this lifestyle, or makes you feel especially feminine and beautiful.
Most of the time when we discuss gender stuff and porn, the arguments boil down to, "What I like is good and what I dislike is bad." Human sexualities are stupid complicated and essentially everyone has their own unique set of preferences for body types and personality, kinks, and turn offs. It's not really a place where there's much to debate about specifics. There's only a few generalizations that can really be made, like pedophile porn being clearly bad since it actually hurts the children involved.
Hmm... This short guy (who definitely can't get a girlfriend because he's short btw) sure looks happy considering he's dating a gross ogre.
Some will, there are plenty of opposition media outlets that would jump on this. If the leading narrative media doesnt want to report something because it doesnt conform to their standards of what is right/wrong. GO to opposition, even if you dont agree with those people on other things.
fakecel fags that like to fucking larp that they are incel are the most pathetic pieces of trash I've come across
For me, everybody's like, "there she is!," or "ask her out!," or "get her number, quick!", but I always respond with "uh, no, I'm not that kind of person. I want to say hi and get to know her first. I don't want to be known as one who overburdens girls with requests or demands or thrusts upon her suddenly such duties in the first five or so minutes." Oh and if your do wanna have sex \[insert girl's name here\], I'm Christian so wait.
Anyone else feel that the word mother shouldnt be used in these cases? What a monster.
This is pure speculation, but I think Reddit's demographics are skewed far younger. The people on 4chan either moved on from the platform or matured it while Reddit keeps seeing an influx of teens and very young adults.
